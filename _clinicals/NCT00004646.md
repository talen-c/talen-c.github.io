    OBJECTIVES: I. Characterize the effect of prednisone on muscle protein metabolism in
          patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

          II. Determine whether prednisone changes levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, growth
          hormone, and insulin.

          III. Characterize the effect of prednisone on muscle morphometry and muscle localization of
          utrophin.

          IV. Compare the prednisone response in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy to that
          seen in normal individuals and in patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy.
