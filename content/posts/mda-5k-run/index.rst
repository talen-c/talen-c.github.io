MDA 5K Run
I got this in my inbox from Lucas Coe, who is one of the coordinators for the MDA in the Charlotte area:


Hello there!

I wanted to share a great opportunity with you.  One of our Camp Counselors from last year’s Summer Camp was so touched by what MDA does that she has started a 5K to raise money for MDA.  If you are like me, you probably don’t run yourself, but know people who do, so I wanted to send this along so you can share with any friends you have who are runners.  If you have any questions, please let me know!

From the Camp Counselor, Lisa:

After volunteering at MDA summer camp, I really wanted to find a way to raise money and help more. The campers are so awesome and, as a Winthrop cross country and track athlete, the best way I could think of was to have a 5K fundraiser titled "Run For Those Who Can't." This race will be held on April 27th. Check in starts at 8am and the race will take off at 9. It will start from the Winthrop coliseum, in Rock Hill, SC, loop around a lake, and will finish on Winthrop's mondo track. Just like camp this year, there's a superhero theme for whoever wants to dress up! The last day to sign up with the lower pricing and get a t-shirt is April 13th. It should be really fun, and of course, is a great cause. You can sign up through the PayPal link at the event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/419556831433530/

Lucas has been a lot of help over the past year, and we didn't make it to the MDA Muscle Walk in March, so I figured the least we could do was pass the word along. Lisa has been wanting to run in a 5K (she's talking about doing some zombie run), so maybe if a few other people are interested I can get her to sign up also...
