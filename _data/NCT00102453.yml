    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive disease of skeletal muscle caused by the
          absence of dystrophin due to a genetic mutation in the x-linked dystrophin gene. The absence
          of dystrophin results in a fragile muscle membrane that permits an abnormal permeability to
          electrolytes, especially Ca ++. The increase in intracellular calcium triggers a
          pathological cascade of events that ultimately results in muscle necrosis and fibrosis,
          which impedes normal muscle regeneration. The increased knowledge of the pathophysiology of
          DMD opens the opportunity for pharmacological treatment, with the purpose of altering the
          disease process and or reverting the muscle degeneration.

          This research study requires having Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the subject to be
          between 4 and 7 years old. We expect 5 children to take part in this study at Children's
          Hospital and 10 other children to participate at other hospitals worldwide.

          There will be two (2) screening visits to help decide whether you will be able to
          participate in the study. At the second screening visit, there will be a blood test (about
          13 tablespoons of blood), and an EKG. Once the study doctors decide eligibility to be in the
          study, the subject will then come back once a month for three months to have his strength
          tested. After three months, the subject will begin to take the pentoxifylline and have an
          MRI (you will have a test called an MRI to look inside the muscles of your legs). This will
          continue for 12 months.

                        duplication, or other mutation resulting in a stop codon mutation) that can be
                        definitely associated with DMD, with a typical clinical picture of DMD.

                5. Positive family history of DMD confirmed by one of the criteria listed above in a

                1. Symptomatic DMD carrier

                2. Use of any medication, nutritional supplement or herb for treatment of DMD within the

    muscle strength. Measurements of force are collected using a load cell while performing
    a maximum voluntary isometric contraction. This set-up is able to measure changes
    in strength of 0.25 lb which provides accurate and sensitive measurement of muscular
    strength. QMT is performed by a CINRG physical therapist.

    In this study, the primary aim will be to estimate the magnitude and variability of strength
          change over time that may be expected for subjects on the study treatment. This estimate of
          effect will allow us to develop a rigorous statistical plan in the future randomized study.
          The specific estimation technique to be applied will use a linear random effects model to
          estimate average strength change during the 3-month lead-in period and then during the
          twelve-month treatment period, taking into account the quantitative muscle testing (QMT)
          measures for each subject. Accounting for the correlation between repeated measures from
          each subject by using a random effects model will yield an unbiased estimate of variability
          for the population average change in strength. We will use an analysis of pre- and
          post-treatment data to inform a best estimate of treatment effect. For example, the
          difference in QMT trends pre- and post-treatment would provide a straightforward measure of
          efficacy.
