    This Phase 3, open label safety and efficacy study will be performed at participating sites
          worldwide. The study will enroll ~ 220 boys with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy who
          participated in a previous Phase 3 study of ataluren (Protocol # PTC124-GD-020-DMD).
          Patients will receive 10, 10, 20 mg/kg of ataluren TID at morning, midday, and evening for
          approximately 96 weeks. Study assessments will be performed at clinic visits every 12 weeks.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Completion of study treatment in the previous Phase 3, double-blind study protocol
                   (Protocol PTC124-GD-020-DMD).

                -  Evidence of signed and dated informed consent/assent document(s) indicating that the
                   patient (and/or his parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent aspects
                   of the trial.

                -  Willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ an approved method of
                   contraception during the period of study drug administration and 6-week follow-up
                   period.

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
                   study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of the study drug

                -  Ongoing participation in any clinical trial (except for studies specifically approved
                   by PTC Therapeutics).

                -  Prior or ongoing medical condition (eg, concomitant illness, psychiatric condition,
                   behavioral disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings, ECG
                   findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could
                   adversely affect the safety of the subject, makes it unlikely that the course of
                   treatment or follow-up would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study
                   results.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Dystrophinopathy is a disease continuum that includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which
          develops in boys. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is
          important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes
          muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability. A specific type of
          mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of dystrophinopathy
          in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
          investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense
          mutation. The main goal of this Phase 3 extension study is to obtain long term safety of
          ataluren in boys with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy as determined by adverse events and
          laboratory abnormalities. The study will also assess changes in physical function, pulmonary
          function and other important clinical and laboratory measures.
