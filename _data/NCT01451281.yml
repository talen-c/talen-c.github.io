    Objective:

          Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent inherited fatal childhood disease.
          Antisense oligonucleotide (AON)-induced exon skipping is a promising therapeutic strategy
          for DMD that is currently being explored in clinical trials. Magnetic resonance imaging
          (MRI) and ultrasound imaging methods are sensitive to key processes in dystrophic muscle
          such as edema and fat infiltration and therefore could serve as a biomarker of disease
          progression and therapeutic response. Our objective is to explore the potential of these
          imaging biomarkers for GSK2402968 (AON) effects in ambulatory boys with DMD. The primary
          objective is to assess longitudinal changes in skeletal muscle structural MRI measures
          reflecting fat and edema in the lower extremities in ambulatory boys with DMD receiving
          GSK2402968 or placebo

          Study Population:

          We aim to enroll up to 65 ambulatory boys with DMD. Healthy volunteer/control boys (up to
          25) matched for the age-range will be recruited to obtain pilot data for imaging studies.

          Design:

          This prospective study of skeletal muscle, cardiac, and diaphragm imaging at the NIH will be
          offered to all subjects participating in a phase 2, double blind, exploratory
          parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical study in ambulatory subjects with DMD resulting
          from a mutation that can be corrected by exon 51 skipping induced by GSK2402968 (parent
          study; DMD114876). Subjects will travel with a family member to the NIH for MRI and
          ultrasound assessments during the screening phase of the parent study or up to 3 weeks after
          randomization and additionally at the following time points in the parent study: at 12 weeks
          ( 3 weeks), and 24 weeks ( 3 weeks) during the blinded treatment period; and finally, after
          completion of 24 week post-treatment phase (at 48 weeks 4 weeks). If not randomized, the
          subjects will have a one-time evaluation during the screening phase of the parent study.
          Pilot data also will be obtained from healthy boys (matched for the age-range) for
          comparisons to allow exploration of MRI and ultrasound measures specific to pathology in the
          ambulatory boys with DMD. Subjects will not be treated with GSK2402968 or any other
          experimental drug at the NIH. There are no follow-up or termination procedures for this
          study.

          Outcome Measures:

          Primary Outcome Measure: MRI changes in skeletal muscle percent fat in the lower extremities
          using T1w GRE Dixon method at 24 weeks from baseline in the parent study in ambulatory boys
          with DMD receiving GSK2402968 or placebo. Secondary outcome measures: Differences in the
          following outcome measures between healthy boys and ambulatory boys with DMD at baseline;
          and changes in these measures over time in the parent study at 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 48
          weeks from baseline in ambulatory boys with DMD receiving GSK2402968 or placebo: 1. Skeletal
          muscle MRI: relative muscle fat/water quantified by T1w GRE Dixon imaging method in skeletal
          muscles; Muscle edema assessed by T2 imaging; Muscle fat/water content and edema
          additionally quantified by IDEAL-CPMG method; and 2. Cardiac MRI: Cardiac function (ejection
          fraction/ LV function) assessed by SSFP Cine MRI and manual planimetry of LV volumes and
          mass at end systole and end diastole; Myocardial fat content assessed by Multiecho Dixon Fat
          /Water Separation method; Myocardial edema assessed by T2 quantification; Myocardial T1
          assessed by MOLLI (modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery).

          Exploratory Outcome Measures: MRI changes in muscle architecture and water diffusivity will
          be assessed by Diffusion EPI MRI. If well tolerated, then we will use a portable device
          (Ankle IntelliStretch device, RehabTek) to study the effects of exercise on selected MRI
          measures in leg muscles. Muscle ultrasound will be used to monitor changes in skeletal
          muscle volume, echogenicity and stiffness. Dynamic breathing MRI will be performed to
          measure diaphragm motion during free breathing and voluntary maximal inspiration and
          exhalation.

    Background:

          - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease in which the muscles are unable to make the
          protein dystrophin. Without this protein, the muscles become gradually weaker. A new
          medicine called GSK2402968 is being tested to see if it can help prevent or slow down this
          loss of muscle strength. In this study, boys with DMD and healthy volunteers will have
          different types of imaging studies to see which ones provide the best images of the muscles.
          This information will help researchers use these imaging techniques to test the safety and
          effectiveness of GSK2402968 and other agents.

          Objectives:

          - To test magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound techniques that can detect changes in
          muscles of boys with DMD.

          Eligibility:

            -  Boys who have DMD and are in the GSK2402968 drug test study.

            -  Healthy boys of the same age as the above study participants.

          Design:

            -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.

            -  Healthy volunteers will have one 2-hour visit with three tests. Magnetic resonance
               imaging (MRI) scans of the skeletal muscles and heart and diaphragm muscles will be
               carried out. Muscle ultrasound imaging of leg and arm muscles will also be done.
               Participants should not perform heavy physical activity like school sports or long
               walks during the week before the visit.

            -  Participants in the GSK2402968 study will have the same series of tests as the healthy
               volunteers. The tests will be given during the study screening phase. They will be
               repeated after 3 months and 6 months of receiving the study agent (GSK2402968 or
               placebo) and at 6 months after stopping the GSK study.
