    Muscular dystrophy leads to progressive loss of function in all muscles during childhood and
          adolescence, including the heart. The usual method to evaluate the heart is
          echocardiography, emphasizing few parameters. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not as
          widely available as echocardiography, but early changes can be detected before they become
          visible on echocardiography. In this study, the investigators compare the methods of
          measuring heart function in order to find the best measurements for follow up and to see how
          fast the degenerative changes occur in the hearts of patients with muscular dystrophy.

  textblock: |-
    This study evaluates the function of the heart in young patients with muscular dystrophy
          type Duchenne or Becker. Participants have their hearts examined at regular intervals by
          ultrasound (echocardiography) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
