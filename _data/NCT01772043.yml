    The purpose of this tissue bank is to collect blood and skin samples from participants who
          are diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and carry one of nine specific changes
          in the dystrophin gene. The specific dystrophin changes that we are interested in studying
          are those that would work with exon-skipping therapies in patients with DMD, specifically
          deletions of the follow exons: 10-52, 13-50, 29-50, 43-52, 44, 43-50, 45-50, 45-52, 46,
          46-47, 46-48, 46-49, 46-51, 46-53, 46-55, 46-60, 47-50, 47-52, 48-50, 49-50, 50, 52, 52-63,
          48-52, 49-52, 50-52.

          These blood and skin samples will be held in a tissue bank at Carolinas Medical Center for
          future DMD research.

      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in
              the dystrophin gene. DMD participants over 4 years of age with known mutations that could
              be targeted by exon skipping therapies will be recruited for this study.
  criteria:
    textblock: |-
      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Age 4 and above

                -  Diagnosis of DMD with a confirmed out-of-frame dystrophin gene deletions that could
                   be corrected by skipping exon 45, 51, or 53 based on past genetic testing.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Investigator assessment of inability to comply with blood and skin sample collection

    We will utilize the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) network
          to collect and store tissue and blood from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
          with specific genetic mutations within the dystrophin gene that could be treated by
          antisense oligonucleotide (AO) drugs.
