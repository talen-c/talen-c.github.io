      Subject Inclusion Criteria

                1. Age: 5 - 11 years old

                2. Ambulant

                3. Diagnosis of DMD confirmed by at least one the following:

                     -  Positive X-linked family history for typical Duchenne muscular dystrophy in
                        older male relatives (onset by age 5 yr., wheelchair-bound by age 12 yr.) OR

                     -  Dystrophin immunofluorescence and/or immunoblot showing complete dystrophin
                        deficiency, and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy OR

                     -  Gene deletion test positive (missing one or more exons) in the central rod
                        domain (exons 25-60) of dystrophin, where reading frame can be predicted as
                        `out-of-frame', and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy.

                4. On Glucocorticosteroids: Children must be on a steady dose of prednisone or
                   deflazacort, on any schedule (Daily, alternate days, 10 days on, 10 days off or twice
                   a week), for the last 6 months before starting the clinical trial. Dose of steroid or
                   schedule cannot be altered during the study.

                5. Evidence of muscle weakness by MRC score or clinical functional evaluation

                6. Ability to provide reproducible repeat QMT bicep score within 10% of first assessment
                   score.

                7. Ability to swallow tablets

              Subject Exclusion Criteria

                1. Failure to achieve one or more of the diagnostic inclusion criteria cited above.

                2. Symptomatic DMD carrier

                3. Previous (6 months or less) or current use of Coenzyme Q10 (for DMD or any other
                   disease)

                4. Use of carnitine, other amino acids, creatine, glutamine, or any herbal medicines
                   within the last 3 months.

                5. History of significant concomitant illness or significant impairment of renal or
                   hepatic function.

  Muscular Dystrophy

  textblock: |-
    This study will help to determine the safety and efficacy of the nutritional supplement
          Coenzyme Q10 when added to steroids as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
          Boys with DMD who are enrolled in this study will should be on a stable dose of steroids for
          at least six months, and will remain on their usual dose throughout the study. They will
          complete two screening visits within a one-week period, and if enrolled will then have their
          strength tested monthly for three months before beginning therapy with Coenzyme Q10. Once
          Coenzyme Q10 therapy is started, participants will have their strength tested monthly for
          six months. Following the six month treatment period, participants will be given the option
          to remain on Coenzyme Q10 until the study is completed.
