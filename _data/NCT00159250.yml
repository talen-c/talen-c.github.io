    Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy affecting 1
          in every 3500 live male births. The disease is characterised by severe muscle wasting and
          weakness, which becomes clinically evident between the ages of 3 to 5 years. Affected
          individuals stop walking by 12 years of age and usually do not survive beyond the age of 20
          unless ventilated. In general DMD is caused by mutations that disrupt the reading frame thus
          leading to a failure to express dystrophin.

          Recent scientific research has led to the belief that DMD may be treated by correcting the
          genetic error in the dystrophin gene which causes DMD. Most children with DMD have a
          deletion, i.e., a mutation which removes part of the dystrophin gene. A novel technique
          using antisense technology to skip a specific exon and bypass faulty genetic material, thus
          allowing production of functional dystrophin to be produced, has been developed.These
          antisense oligonucleotides (AON) target and bypass faulty genetic material and allow
          production of functional protein.This has been successfully demonstrated in cultured human
          DMD cells and in mouse and canine DMD models.The restored production of dystrophin is
          predicted to reduce muscle pathology significantly.

          In the early part of the study we compared different antisense oligomers chemical
          modification and concluded that the morpholino backbone is significantly superior when
          administered to skeletal muscle compared to a number of other types of antisense.

          The aim of this phase I/II clinical study is to assess efficacy and safety of AVI-4658, a
          morpholino antisense directed against exon 51, in DMD individuals with deletions which would
          benefit from skipping exon 51.

          The proposed work is presented in 4 sections detailing the main approaches.

          Study design

          This dose escalation IM trial will involve of up to 9 subjects, subdivided in three groups,
          of three subjects each. Patients in group 1 will be recruited sequentially whilst patients
          in groups 2 and 3 will be recruited serially.

            -  Group 1 (3 patients) will receive intramuscular administration of a low concentration
               of study drug (extensor digitorum brevis muscle, EDB) and will undergo a muscle biopsy
               between days 14 and 28 after intramuscular (IM) administration of the AVI-4658.

            -  Group 2 (3 patients) will undergo an identical procedure but receiving an intermediate
               dose of the AVI-4658.

            -  Group 3 (3 patients) will be recruited to receive the highest dose of the AVI-4658 but
               only if the results in the first 2 cohort of patients show a lack of efficacy of the
               lower doses. Up to an additional 3 subjects may be enrolled in cohorts 1 or 2, should
               cohort 3 not be enrolled.

          Screening

            -  A physical examination, including body weight, height, arm span, neuromuscular
               examination and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature).

            -  Neuropsychiatric assessment of both subject and the family.

            -  Molecular genetic on blood sample and dystrophin analysis of original muscle biopsy
               obtained at diagnosis.

            -  Muscle MRI scans of lower limbs to assess the preservation of the muscle to be targeted
               with the injection of AON.

            -  Biochemical (blood) and urine investigation to include standard biochemistry and
               haematology (FBC; coagulation screen; LFT; serum Ig; protein electrophoresis;
               inflammatory markers; CK; gamma GT; urine biochemistry).

            -  Cardiovascular assessments: ECG and heart echocardiogram.

            -  Pulmonary assessments: FVC, overnight oxygen saturation monitoring.

            -  Skin biopsy for MyoD-transfection.

          Procedure

            -  The muscle to be used is the extensor digitorum brevis, a foot muscle with very little
               function in children with mobility difficulties.

            -  Local injection will be performed directly through the skin using a combined
               EMG-delivery needle. While the procedure could be performed under local anaesthetic;
               where possible, it will be performed under general anaesthetic in order to reduce
               distress to the subject. A skin tattoo featuring a 1 cm x 1 cm grid with 2 lines in
               between to divide it in 9 smaller squares will be used to mark the site of the
               injection precisely and for a subsequent muscle biopsy.

            -  The total volume of each injection will be 100 Î¼L containing the AVI-4658. Nine
               injections will be performed at 3 mm intervals inside the 1 cm2 grid tattoo. The depth
               of the injection will be carefully recorded.

          Observation

            -  Patients will be closely monitored within the clinical research facility by designated
               nursing staff educated in the trial protocol and with experience in similar Phase I/II
               studies.

            -  The clinical research facility has close access to intensive care unit facilities in
               the event of an unforeseen adverse reaction.

          Follow-up Day 2 - Patients will be discharged. Prior to discharge, a brief physical
          examination and systems review will be performed.

          Day 3 - A further brief physical examination and systems review including examination of the
          injection sites and reporting of any reactions. This examination can be performed at the
          local surgery or at the hospital of the referring clinician.

          Days 5, 7 - Contact with the subject and inquire as to current status.

          Day 14 to 28 - The subject is admitted to hospital. Perform systems assessment (physical
          examination), body weight and vital signs. Blood and urine biochemistry will be repeated
          then as well as open biopsies of both injected muscles will be performed under general or
          local anaesthetic.

          Day 30 - Contact with the subject and inquiry as to current status.

          Day 60 - Contact the subject and inquiry as to current status.

          Day 120 - (Final Visit at the hospital where the study drug was administered). A brief
          physical examination and systems review will be performed.

  textblock: |-
    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal muscle degenerative disorder, arises from
          mutations in the dystrophin gene. Antisense therapy with the use of antisense
          oligonucleotides (AON) has the potential to restore effectively the production of
          dystrophin, the defective protein, in >70% of DMD. This could result in increased life
          expectancy through improved muscle survival and function. Recent scientific research has
          demonstrated the potential of this technique to skip mutated dystrophin exons, restore the
          reading frame and generate functional dystrophin protein. Having demonstrated
          proof-of-principle in human cell culture and animal model studies, we now intend to
          determine efficacy and safety of this approach to induce dystrophin exon skipping in
          children with DMD.

          The specific aim of this phase I/II study is to assess efficacy (dystrophin production) and
          safety of intramuscular administered morpholino oligomer directed against exon 51 (AVI-4658
          PMO). We are performing parallel preclinical studies to develop methods of systemic delivery
          that will be necessary for future phase II/III clinical studies.
