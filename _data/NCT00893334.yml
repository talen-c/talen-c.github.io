    Specific Aims:

          Aim 1: Evaluate integrity of the extracellular matrix in patients with LGMD by measuring
          serum growth factors and cytokines and compare these to a disease control (BMD) and normal
          volunteers.

          Aim 2: Measure growth factors and cytokines following medical evaluation and compare them to
          the baseline levels.

          Aim 3: Discovery Aim for future multicenter clinical trials in LGMD. Aim 3A: Abstract
          medical records with particular emphasis on age of disease onset, initial clinical symptoms,
          progression and location of the muscular weakness, treatments attempted, and other medical
          complications. A review of the diagnostic testing performed will also be conducted.

          Aim 3B: Perform complete clinical evaluation including anthropometric measures, evaluation
          of joint limitations, timed functional testing, muscle strength, pulmonary function, and a
          cardiac assessment.

          Aim 3C: Determine patient understanding of diagnosis of LGMD and genetic testing results. A
          questionnaire will be generated that addresses the patient's understanding of his/her
          diagnosis as well as their understanding of genetic concepts of autosomal recessive
          inheritance, genes, molecular testing and implications for themselves as well as their
          family.

          Aim 3D: Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires will be administered. These will be used to
          identify functional limitations by the patients and compare those limitations with the
          clinical evaluation.

          Study Description

          Only one visit will be necessary for this study. The study visit includes:

            1. Review of the informed consent form

            2. Blood collection Blood will be collected for the following: DNA extraction to confirm
               genotype if not already performed; Muscle Enzymes before and after physical evaluation;
               and Growth factors and cytokines: before and after physical evaluation.

            3. Medical history review

            4. Physical Examination

            5. Questionnaires: Participants will complete 3 questionnaires: Diagnosis and genetic
               testing, ACTIVLIM, and INQoL

            6. Clinical Evaluator assessment which includes: Manual Muscle Testing, Quantitative
               Muscle Testing, Pulmonary Function Testing, Anthropometric measurements, and Timed and
               Functional testing

            7. Cardiac evaluation will include: Electrocardiogram and Echocardiogram

          Control subjects will be required to come to the test site to complete the informed consent
          process, clinical evaluator assessment, and have blood drawn before and after the clinical
          evaluator assessment. No other examinations or procedures will be performed on the control
          participants.

      The subject population will include all patients diagnosed LGMD2I, LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and
              BMD. BMD is an X-linked recessive condition that only affects males. It has been described
              in all ethnic backgrounds. LGMD2I, LGMD2A and LGMD2B are autosomal recessive conditions
              affecting both males and females of all ethnic backgrounds equally, both sexes and all
              ethnicities are expected to be equally represented. Clinical symptoms manifest in the
              second decade of life, therefore all participants will be over the age of 18. Healthy
              controls will be recruited to match the study population based on age, sex, and ethnicity.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The purpose of this study is to understand the biochemistry of different types of
          Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) and to determine appropriate outcome measures for
          future clinical treatment trials for LGMD. It is being conducted at two sites in the
          Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG). It involves a one day
          clinical evaluation at a participating institution that will take approximately four to six
          hours, and will involve strength testing and muscle functional testing by a physical
          therapist, an evaluation by a physician, pulmonary function testing, a complete cardiac
          evaluation with electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and echocardiogram (Echo), and involve two
          blood draws, one before the evaluation and one after the evaluation is complete. During the
          visit, the participant will be asked to fill out a couple of questionnaires asking questions
          about quality of life and activity limitations, as well as his/her understanding of their
          diagnosis with regards to etiology (or cause of their muscle disorder), genetics, and
          inheritance of their muscle disorder.
