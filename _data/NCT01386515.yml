    This study proposes to explore the role of family functioning in promoting adaptation in
          unaffected siblings of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Although evidence
          suggests that family functioning may be a predictor of adaptation in caregivers of children
          with chronic illnesses, little research has been conducted on the relationships between
          aspects of family functioning and the adaptation of unaffected siblings. Evidence in the
          literature suggests that aspects of family functioning may play a key role in adaptation.
          Moreover, the role of DMD-specific communication in facilitating sibling adaptation has not
          yet been explored in the literature and further insight may be derived from exploring this
          relationship. The goals of this study are to better understand the relationship of family
          functioning with the adaptation of unaffected siblings, as well as to explore the timing,
          extent (depth and content), and the characteristics of initiation of discussion of
          parent-sibling communication around DMD. Currently, some evidence exists to direct the
          creation of interventions that reinforce a family-centered approach to facilitate adaptation
          of family members to living with a child with a chronic health condition. Nevertheless, more
          insight is needed to understand how family processes affect individual adaptation,
          especially that of the unaffected sibling, in order to maximize the effectiveness of future
          interventions with this population.

    Background:

          We want to learn more about the relationship between the way families function and how
          children adapt to having a sibling with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). What we learn
          will help us design better interventions for families.

          Objective:

            -  To learn more about how families with an individual with DMD function.

            -  To learn how siblings adapt in families with an individual with DMD.

          Eligibility:

            -  One parent and one child, age 13-18, from a family where another child has DMD.

            -  The parent and the child must be able to read and write English.

          Design:

            -  One parent from each family will complete a survey about how family members communicate
               and relate with each other. The parent will also answer questions about the behavior of
               the child without DMD. This survey will take you about 40 minutes to complete.

            -  One child from each family, either a boy or a girl, will also complete a survey. This
               survey asks about how he/she views him/herself. It also asks about how he/she interacts
               with peers and family members and how he/she behaves. The survey also asks how
               satisfied he/she is with how his/her family functions. This survey takes about 30
               minutes to finish.
