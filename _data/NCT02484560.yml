    Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked genetic disorder primarily affecting males,
          resulting in an absence of dystrophin which ultimately leads to progressive muscle
          degeneration. Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath,
          and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although
          several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient.
          Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of
          the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking
          independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently.

          The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cell
          Therapy in Ambulatory and Non-ambulatory Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and
          determine its suitability as a form of treatment.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Ambulatory and Non-ambulatory patients diagnosed with DMD that is proven both
                   clinically and genetically and are between 5-20 years old who need partial
                   respiratory support daily. Patients with less than or equal to stage 1 NIH, cardiac,
                   liver, and renal function. Patients must also not present any indication of cancer,
                   allergic disease, nor bleeding diathesis.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Patients who require full respiratory support. Patients have stage II NIH or greater,
                   cardiac, liver, and renal function. Patients present with signs of symptoms of
                   cancer, allergic disease, or bleeding diathesis.
