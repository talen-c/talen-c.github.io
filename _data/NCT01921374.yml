    The Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by genetic
          alteration, whose consequence is the progression of muscle degeneration. The
          mother-caregiver dedicates herself entirely to her son, putting aside the care of their
          physical and psychological health. The responsibility and workload to care for the child is
          high. Because of this extreme amount of work associated with other factors such as stress,
          this mothers-caregivers are more likely to develop hypertension, respiratory disease,
          susceptibility to infections, depression, anxiety, insomnia, impaired immune and
          cardiovascular problems. Moreover, they are more likely to develop sleep disorders, those
          who may cause a high health risk, since many sleep disorders are related to cardiovascular,
          respiratory, neurological and immune systems.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The incidence of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is approximately 1 in 3.500 male
          newborns. During its progression there is loss of mobility, swallowing difficulties and a
          significant reduction in respiratory capacity. Due to the severity and consequences, is
          inevitable the need for a caregiver, that normally rely the mother.
