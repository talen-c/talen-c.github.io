    Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to
          the body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of
          the endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase
          the level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and
          brain cells.

          It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20
          microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could
          prevent, control, manage or possibly cure these neuromuscular disorders.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of more than 30 neuromuscular disorders that are
          characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness, defects in muscle proteins and the
          death of muscle cells and tissue. This study will investigate the use of far infrared
          radiation for managing muscular dystrophies.
