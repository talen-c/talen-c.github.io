    The proposed study aims to examine the relationships between maternal uncertainty, hope, and
          coping efficacy in mothers of children with Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD). DBMD
          is described as a complex chronic condition causing challenges exemplified by both chronic
          and terminal illnesses. Parental adaptation to a child s DBMD diagnosis is multifaceted due
          to the evolution of the disease and uncertain timing of the progressive losses the child and
          family face. In addition to prognostic uncertainty associated with DBMD, there is
          uncertainty about the management of the condition, future and reproductive planning, the
          family s social connections, and the existential meaning of the child s life. It is not
          fully understood how mothers of children with DBMD appraise, cope with, and ultimately adapt
          to their child s condition in light of this uncertainty. While high degrees of perceived
          uncertainty may be seen as a threat to coping and adaptation, there is evidence that
          caregivers may find benefits in uncertainty. The theoretical literature suggests that a
          person s hope may influence the appraisal of uncertainty, as well as have therapeutic value
          in positively affecting coping and ultimately, adaptation. This study s conceptual framework
          is based on an integrated model from Lazarus and Folkman s Transactional Model of Stress and
          Coping, Mishel s Perceived Uncertainty in Illness Theory, and Dufault and Martocchio s Model
          of Hope. The proposed study uses a cross-sectional research design to explore the
          relationships between maternal uncertainty, hope, and coping efficacy and is nested within a
          larger longitudinal study designed to examine the predictors of wellbeing among mothers of
          boys with DBMD. In addition, open-ended questions will be used to describe the uncertainty
          the mothers perceive and the impact uncertainty has had on their life. Participants were
          recruited through the DuchenneConnect registry, Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD),
          and Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center Neuromuscular Clinic. Additional mothers
          will be recruited through the DuchenneConntect registry, PPMD, and the Muscular Dystrophy
          Association.

    Background:

          - Children with Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD) slowly lose muscle function. They
          usually die at a young age. Some mothers adapt to the demands of caring for a child with
          this disease better than others. Studies show that a person s hope may positively affect how
          they cope and adapt. Researchers want to find out more about this. They want to develop ways
          to improve caregivers overall wellness.

          Objective:

          - To study the relationships between uncertainty, hope, and coping ability in mothers of
          children with DBMD.

          Eligibility:

          - Women in the United States 18 years and older. They must be biological mothers of a living
          child with DBMD and be able to answer a survey in English.

          Design:

            -  This study is part of a larger study that examines the well-being of mothers with sons
               who have DBMD.

            -  Participants will take a questionnaire. The questionnaire can be done on paper or on a
               computer. It will take 30 45 minutes to complete.

            -  The questionnaire will include basic demographic questions about the participant and
               the child. There will also be questions about how the participant copes with the stress
               and uncertainty of DBMD.

            -  For most of the questions, participants will rate their feelings on a scale. There will
               also be four open-ended questions.
