    Pediatric Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques have been limited by the unavailability
          of specialized radio-frequency (RF) coils for pediatric imaging. Typically, MR coils are
          designed for general purpose adult imaging and lack the mechanical design, flexibility and
          high channel count needed for pediatric imaging. Furthermore, pediatric patients are often
          positioned decubitus or prone rather than supine. This makes coil positioning even more
          challenging and often results in images with low SNR and poor image quality. Many coils used
          in clinical practice have fixed dimensions that do not fit within the realm of "one-size
          fits all," especially for the huge variation found in the pediatric patient population.

          MRI coil development and optimization is performed by MR manufacturers and in research
          laboratories across the world including the Imaging Research Center (IRC) of Cincinnati
          Children's Hospital and Medical Center (CCHMC). Coil development and refinement involves
          evaluating the new coils on inert phantoms and then imaging examinations performed on
          healthy participants and patients. The focus of this study protocol is to evaluate the
          design and performance of investigational coils on patients and healthy participants.

      Healthy participants will be recruited by word-of-mouth, generally from within CCHMC.The
              healthy participants could include children of faculty or staff members of CCHMC.Because
              the healthy participants could include children of faculty or staff members, recruitment
              will be consistent with CCHMC Research Policy.Patients will be recruited at the time of
              their scheduled clinical scan.We are only using these participants to evaluate the safety
              and feasibility of the use of the new coils in our patient population.For this reason, we
              will not focus on the demographics of the participants.However, we will attempt to obtain
              a broad anatomic size range to match that of the patient population for which the coils
              were developed.
