    The primary objective of this study is the assessment of the safety of an intramuscular
          administration of rAAVrh74.MCK.micro-Dystrophin to the Extensor Digitorum Brevis (EDB)
          muscle of patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Safety will be assessed by
          changes in hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, immunologic response to rAAVrh74 and
          micro-Dystrophin protein, and reported history and observations of symptoms. Subjects will
          be evaluated at baseline, injection visit (days 0-2), and return for follow up visits on
          days 7, 14, 30,60, 90, and 180 and at the end of 1st and 2nd years. On Day 180, subjects
          will undergo a muscle biopsy on the injected muscles in one foot compared with
          placebo-treatment in the opposite foot to establish transgene expression and any potential
          toxicity from gene transfer.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The proposed phase I clinical trial is a pilot study to evaluate safety and biological
          activity of the rAAVrh74.MCK.micro-Dystrophin vector administered by an intramuscular route.
          This study will evaluated the micro-Dystrophin vector as a potential dystrophin replacement
          mechanism for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Two cohorts will undergo gene transfer in a
          standard three-six dose escalation scheme to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using
          toxicity. A minimum of three subjects will be enrolled into each cohort. The first cohort
          will receive a total dose of 3E11 vg. The second cohort will receive 1E12 vg total dose.
