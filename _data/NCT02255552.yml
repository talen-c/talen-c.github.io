    This is an open-label, multi-center, 48-week study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
          eteplirsen in patients with genotypically confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with
          genetic deletions amenable to exon 51 skipping (treated group), with a concurrent control
          arm of DMD patients not amenable to exon 51 skipping (untreated group). Following primary
          efficacy endpoints at week 48, dosing will continue to week 96 to evaluate the long term
          effects of eteplirsen.

          Patients in the treated group will receive once weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 30
          mg/kg Eteplirsen. Patients in the untreated group will not receive treatment.

          Clinical efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits, including functional
          tests such as the six minute walk test. Patients in the treated group will undergo a muscle
          biopsy at Baseline and a second muscle biopsy over the course of the study. Patients in the
          untreated group will not undergo muscle biopsy.

          Safety, including adverse event monitoring and routine laboratory assessments, will be
          continuously monitored for all patients.

          The sponsor is working to initiate approximately 39 sites across the United States. Sites
          will vary in the following functions:

            1. Local Site (N=39) - Enrolls patients and is the primary contact point for their
               patients. Sites will perform all protocol activities (including dosing and laboratory
               assessments), except for functional assessments and biopsies.

            2. Hub Site (N=14) - Performs functional (physical) assessments at specified times per
               protocol.

            3. Surgical Site (N=2) - Performs muscle biopsies for the Treated group.

condition_browse:

  - Muscular Dystrophies
  - Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne
brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The main objective of this study is to provide confirmatory evidence of efficacy of
          eteplirsen (AVI-4658) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients that are amenable to
          skipping exon 51. Additional objectives include evaluation of safety, biomarkers and the
          long-term effects of eteplirsen up to 96 weeks.

          Sites are currently being initiated into the study. Initiation of approximately 39 planned
          sites in the United States is expected to be completed by November 2015. The initiated sites
          can be found in the "Contacts and Locations" section of this posting in addition to a
          listing of the city and states of sites the investigators are working to initiate. This
          information will be updated on a rolling basis as additional sites are initiated.
