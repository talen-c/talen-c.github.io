brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Obesity with insulin resistance in the paediatric population provides an increasing
          challenge. Children with neurological or neuromuscular diseases are even more prone to
          obesity: their locomotor impairment leads to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, a decrease
          in physical fitness and an increase in body fat (1-3). Obesity, in turn, can be associated
          with a decrease in physical fitness and a further increase in body fat. In this study we
          want to evaluate the effect of an insulin-sensitizer, metformin, in a group of
          overweight/obese patients with neurological or neuromuscular diseases. Metformin is a
          well-established insulin sensitizer.
