    The overall objective of this pilot study is to assess whether a mild to moderate-intensity
          strengthening exercise program can be safely implemented in boys with DMD. In Aim 1, the
          investigators will determine the dose response and safety of mild to moderate-intensity
          isometric resistance exercise in children with DMD. Twelve ambulatory boys with DMD will
          participate in an isometric exercise dosing protocol, in which the load is progressively
          increased. In this early proof of concept pilot study, two large muscle groups will be
          studied: the knee extensors and the knee flexors. T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging
          (MRI) of the thigh muscles will be used to monitor evidence of muscle damage at each
          intensity level and determine a safe exercise range. Other safety measures will include a
          verbal pain rating scale, clinical examination, and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. In
          Aim 2, the investigators will implement a pilot intervention study to examine the
          feasibility and safety of a 12 week in-home isometric strengthening program in children with
          DMD. In this study, 20 boys with DMD will be randomized to either an exercise group or a
          control group. Ten boys with DMD randomized to the exercise group will complete a
          progressive exercise program using the parameters and dose identified in Aim 1. Assessment
          of strength and safety will be performed at regular time intervals throughout the study. Ten
          boys with DMD randomized to not participate in an exercise intervention will be tested at
          similar time intervals and serve as controls. The data from this pilot study will serve to
          perform the power analysis needed to design an appropriately powered clinical intervention
          study.

  description: The experimental group will participate in an isometric exercise strengthening
    intervention with a frequency of ~three times/week for 12 weeks. Training will
    include using a custom-built exercise set-up and a live monitoring system for
    all of the subjects who participate in the experimental group. Progression of
    the exercise program will only occur after safety assessments at weeks 3, 6, and
    9. The safety assessments to occur at baseline, 1 week, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks
    include T2 MRI, Spectroscopic relaxometry, pain rating scale, and CK levels. The
    safety assessments to occur at 3 weeks and 9 weeks include the pain rating scale
    and CK levels. Participants in this group may also be tested for strength assessments
    (of the knee flexors and extensors) and time to climb 4 stairs.

  description: The maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) will be determined for each
    subject. The first four subjects will exercise at an intensity of ~30% of the
    subject's MVC. Subjects will be asked to perform ~4 sets of 6 reps of knee extension
    and knee flexion contractions. 48hs after the exercise is completed a safety assessment
    will be performed for muscle damage. If none has occurred, four additional subjects
    will perform the exercise at the next level of intensity (~50% MVC). Similarly,
    if no damage has occurred at ~50% MVC, four more subjects exercise at ~70% MVC.
    All safety measures will be performed 48hrs after the exercise has been completed
    at each of the levels. These safety assessments include T2 MRI, Spectroscopic
    relaxometry, pain rating scale, and CK levels.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Diagnosis of DMD confirmed by

                     1. clinical history with features before the age of five

                     2. physical examination

                     3. elevated serum creatine kinase level

                     4. absence of dystrophin expression, as determined by immunostain or Western blot
                        (<2%) and/or DNA confirmation of dystrophin mutation.

                -  Age 7 to 9 years: a lower age limit of 7 years was selected, since in our experience
                   children younger than 7 years are likely unable to cooperate and comply with all of
                   the exercise measures as needed. An upper age limit of 9 years has been set as boys
                   with DMD tend to reach a rapid progression into a late ambulatory phase soon after
                   this age.

                -  Ambulatory at the time of the first visit, defined as the ability to walk for at
                   least 100 m without an external assistive device and able to climb four stairs.

                -  Currently using corticosteroids (prednisone or deflazacort) as prescribed by a
                   physician.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Contraindication to an MR examination (e.g. aneurysm clip, severe claustrophobia,
                   magnetic implants)

                -  Presence of a condition in control subjects or a secondary condition in boys with DMD
                   that impacts muscle function or muscle metabolism (e.g. myasthenia gravis, endocrine
                   disorder, mitochondrial disease)

                -  Secondary condition leading to developmental delay or impaired motor control (e.g.
                   cerebral palsy)

                -  Secondary condition that impacts muscle function or muscle metabolism (e.g.
                   myasthenia gravis, endocrine disorder, mitochondrial disease)

                -  Unstable medical condition (e.g. uncontrolled seizure disorder)

                -  Behavioral problems causing an inability to cooperate during testing

    the antecubital vein while the subject is seated. The analysis for CK levels will
    take place at Shands Medical Laboratories, and their staff will perform analyses

  description: In order to examine the distribution of affected tissue (versus unaffected
    tissue) across the lower extremity muscles, multi-slice spin-echo images will
    be acquired from the lower leg and thigh muscles. A pixel-by-pixel T2 map will
    be created for each slice (minimal 8 slices) by fitting the decay in image signal
    intensity (SI) to a single exponential (SI=Aexp-TE/T2+B; A=proton density) with
    respect to echo time (TE). The total affected tissue volume (% of pixels with
    T2 >2SD above control) will be recorded for each of the lower extremity muscles.
    Subsequently, the same T2 weighted spin-echo sequence will be implemented with
    fat suppression (FS) and T2 FS maps are created. Based on the difference in proton
    density between the two spin-echo sequences the T2 FS pixels primarily composed
    of lipid will be eliminated, and the muscle lesion volume (% of unsuppressed pixels
    with elevated T2 values) will be recorded for each of the lower extremity muscles.

    imaging will be performed on the upper leg (thigh). T2 maps of the thigh muscles
    will be created and mean T2 values of the knee extensor muscle group and flexor

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that causes muscle
          breakdown, weakness, and eventual death. Over the last 40 years parents have received little
          guidance on the potential of exercise as a therapeutic strategy to maintain muscle function.
          It is well known that high intensity exercise and eccentric contractions can result in
          muscle damage in dystrophic muscle, yet the absence of muscle loading will conversely result
          in muscle wasting. Recent research in rodent models and milder forms of muscular dystrophy
          supports earlier studies that resistance exercise may have beneficial effects for
          maintenance of muscle mass in dystrophic muscle. However, careful and systematic
          investigation into the safety and feasibility of resistance exercise is needed to consider
          its implementation in boys with DMD.

          The goal of this project is to assess the safety and feasibility of a home based mild to
          moderate-intensity strengthening exercise program in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
          (DMD). Evidence from milder forms of muscular dystrophy and mouse models of DMD suggests
          that strengthening exercise may be beneficial for these children, but this area has not been
          adequately explored using human subjects. The results of this study should provide
          information to assist in the development of scientifically based recommendations concerning
          optimal exercise parameters for patients with DMD.
