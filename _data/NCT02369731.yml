    This is a multicenter, observational study of patients receiving Translarna based on
          inclusion of their data in a registry. This study is intended to enroll 200 patients across
          ~50 care centers in Europe and other regions over a period of ~ 2 years. The study
          population will include patients who are receiving usual care treatment with commercial
          supply of Translarna (or receiving care within a named patient early access program) and who
          provide consent. Patients will be followed for at least 5 years from their date of
          enrollment. Safety and efficacy data will be collected in conjunction with routine visits
          conducted as per usual care. Although there are no protocol-mandated procedures, it is
          expected that physicians and other caregivers will follow published treatment guidelines and
          standards of care.

      The target study population will include patients for whom the decision to prescribe
              Translarna (outside of a clinical trial) has already been made, including patients in
              named patient early access programs. Patients within each prescriber's practice who are or
              will be receiving treatment with Translarna, and who meet the eligibility criteria and
              provide informed consent (either by the patient or through authorisation by a legal
              guardian), will be invited to enroll into the study and will be followed according to the
              protocol.
