    Further study details as provided by Gordon F. Tomaselli, Johns Hopkins University:

          Biospecimen Retention: Blood or tissue samples, hiPSCs and cardiomyocytes reprogrammed from
          hiPSCs Eligible patients will be approached and the study will be explained in full as a
          part of obtaining informed consent for the study. The subjects will have an opportunity to
          ask questions about the study. Control subjects, often but not exclusively family member
          that meet the eligibility criteria will undergo a similar procedure for informed consent.
          Subjects will be evaluated in clinic and will have a 1-3 mm skin biopsy or blood draw (30
          cc). The subjects will be asked about their medical history during the clinic visit but this
          information will not be transmitted to the research laboratories where the iPSCs are
          generated and re-programmed, only the disease genotype will be associated with the samples.
          The samples that will be frozen and stored are whole blood, white blood cells, skin
          biopsies, hiPSCs and reprogrammed cardiomyocytes.

      Participants who have a mutation causing ARVD/C or LQTS or a first degree family member
              with such a gene mutation. Participants, including patients with ARVD/C or LQTS and family
              members, who have previously been genotyped for clinically indicated reasons will be
              approached to join the study.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have driven a paradigm shift in the modeling
          of human disease; the ability to reprogram patient-specific cells holds the promise of an
          enhanced understanding of disease mechanisms and phenotypic variability, with applications
          in personalized predictive pharmacology/toxicology, cell therapy and regenerative medicine.
          This research will collect blood or skin biopsies from patients and healthy controls for the
          purpose of generating cell and tissue models of Mendelian heritable forms of heart disease
          focusing on cardiomyopathies, channelopathies and neuromuscular diseases. Cardiomyocytes
          derived from hiPSCs will provide a ready source of disease specific cells to study
          pathogenesis and therapeutics.
