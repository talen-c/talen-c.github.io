    Background: Respiratory complications are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality
          associated with childhood Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Involvement of the respiratory
          muscles leads to progressive hypoventilation and/or recurrent atelectasis and pneumonia
          secondary to decreased cough efficacy. Lung volume recruitment (LVR) is a means of stacking
          breaths to achieve maximal lung inflation (MIC), prevent micro-atelectasis, and improve
          cough efficacy. Although it has been recommended by some experts as the "standard of care"
          for individuals with neuromuscular disease, the strategy has not been widely implemented in
          DMD given the lack of clinical trials to date to support its efficacy as well as the
          additional burden of care required in a population already requiring multiple interventions.

          Primary Objective: To determine whether LVR, in addition to conventional treatment, is
          successful in reducing decline from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 2 years
          (percent predicted, measured according to American Thoracic Society standards), compared to
          conventional treatment alone in children with DMD.

          Secondary Objectives: To determine differences between children treated with LVR in addition
          to conventional treatment, compared to those treated with conventional treatment alone, in:
          (1) the number of courses of antibiotics, hospitalizations and intensive care admissions for
          respiratory exacerbations, (2) health-related quality of life, and (3) peak cough flow and
          other pulmonary function tests.

          Methods: We propose a 3-year multi-centre randomized controlled trial involving fifteen
          tertiary care pediatric hospitals across Canada. The study population consists of boys aged
          6-16 years with DMD and FVC ≥ 30% of predicted. A sample size of 110 participants will be
          enrolled. This has been informed by chart review and survey of participating centres to be
          feasible, and will be re-assessed with an ongoing internal pilot study. Intervention:
          Participants will be allocated with a minimization procedure to receive conventional
          treatment (non-invasive ventilation, nutritional supplementation, physiotherapy and/or
          antibiotics, as decided by the treating physician) or conventional treatment plus twice
          daily LVR exercises performed with an inexpensive, portable self-inflating resuscitation bag
          containing a one-way valve and a mouthpiece. Data Analysis: The primary outcome (change in
          percent predicted FVC over 2 years) will be compared between the two study groups using an
          analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) that takes into account baseline FVC and minimization
          factors.

          Importance: Decline in pulmonary function among children with DMD negatively affects quality
          of life and predicts mortality. The relatively simple strategy of LVR has the potential to
          optimize pulmonary function and reduce respiratory exacerbations, thereby improving quality
          of life for individuals with DMD. This study is novel in that it is the first randomized
          controlled trial of LVR. A major strength is that the results will give support or refute
          recommendations regarding inclusion of LVR in the standard of care for individuals with DMD
          worldwide.

  criteria:
    textblock: |-
      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Age 6-16 years - This age range was selected as there are accepted normative
                   pulmonary function data and children 6 years of age and older are generally able to
                   reliably perform pulmonary function tests. Children are followed in participating
                   centres until they reach 18 years of age (allowing two years of follow-up).

                -  Clinical phenotypic features consistent with DMD and confirmed by either: (1) Muscle
                   biopsy showing complete dystrophin deficiency; (2) Genetic test positive for deletion
                   or duplication in the dystrophin gene resulting in an 'out-of-frame' mutation; or (3)
                   Dystrophin gene sequencing showing a mutation associated with DMD.

                -  FVC ≥ 30% predicted - This range of pulmonary function was selected to exclude those
                   with severe restrictive respiratory impairment, who are less likely to be able to
                   reliably perform pulmonary function testing over a two year period.

                -  A caregiver willing to provide the therapy

                -  Fluency in English or French

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Unable to perform pulmonary function tests and/or LVR manoeuvre

                -  Presence of an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube

                -  Already using LVR and/or the Respironics in-exsufflator between and during
                   respiratory infections

                -  Known susceptibility to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum

                -  Uncontrolled asthma or other obstructive lung disease

    as it is a strong predictor of subsequent respiratory failure and mortality. Although
    survival is not a realistic endpoint for this trial, given expected mortality
    is less than 5% for the pediatric age group, FVC decline is an appropriate clinical
    laboratory measure and valid surrogate endpoint to use for this trial.

  textblock: |-
    Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is complicated by weak breathing muscles and lung infections.
          "Lung volume recruitment" is a technique performed using a face mask or mouthpiece and a
          hand-held resuscitation bag to stack breaths, inflate the lungs and help clear the airways
          of secretions by increasing the forcefulness of a cough. We believe this will slow down the
          steady loss of lung function, prevent lung infection, and improve quality of life. Our aim
          is to compare the outcome of a group of individuals with DMD treated with standard care to
          another group that also receives lung volume recruitment. If effective, this study will
          change clinical practice by including twice-daily treatment as part of the standard of care
          for individuals with DMD, in order to improve their lung health and quality of life.
