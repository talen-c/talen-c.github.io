  description: The MPI is a sensitive, quantifiable, noninvasive measure of global
    ventricular function that is independent of cardiac geometry and heart rate. MPI
    is collected through standard echocardiogram assessment. MPI is a ratio of the
    total time spent in isovolumic activity (isovolumic contraction time and isovolumic
    relaxation time) to the time spent in ventricular ejection.
  measure: myocardial performance index (MPI)

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The study will include 120 participants aged 8 and up with Duchenne, Becker, or autosomal
          recessive limb-girdle (specifically: LGMD 2C-2F and 2I) muscular dystrophies that have no
          clinical cardiac symptoms. Participants will be randomized to one of four arms: Arm 1 CoQ10
          alone, Arm 2 Lisinopril alone, Arm 3 CoQ10 and Lisinopril or Arm 4 No study medication.
          Randomization will be stratified by ambulatory status and corticosteroid use. The primary
          outcome for the study is the myocardial performance index (MPI), measured by standard
          Doppler echocardiography. The study will last 24 months with visits at Months 0.5,1.5, 6,
          12, 18 and 24.
