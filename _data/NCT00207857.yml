    All patients with DMD have routine PFT's every six months as standard of care. You will be
          randomized in to one of two groups. The group assignment will be chosen by chance, similar
          to flipping a coin. If you are assigned to group one you will first have your regularly
          scheduled PFT in the morning. You will be asked to complete a second PFT that afternoon as
          least 4 hours after the first PFT. You will then be asked to come back to the clinic in two
          weeks and repeat these PFT's, once in the morning and once in the afternoon at least 4 hours
          apart. Each PFT will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. If you are assigned to group two,
          you will have your regularly scheduled PFT in the morning and then a second test in the
          afternoon at least four hours after the first test. After the second PFT you will receive
          training from a Respiratory Therapist. You will receive teaching handouts to take home and
          an incentive spirometer and peak flow meter to practice with. You will be asked to practice
          these tests 2 times a day and record your results. You will then be asked to come back to
          the clinic in two weeks to repeat 2 PFT's, once in the morning and again at least 4 hours
          later. All participants will be asked how they feel at the time of testing.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Nearly all patients with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have scoliosis. Posterior
          instrumented spinal fusion, which is a surgery to correct scoliosis, has been shown to
          improve quality of life and satisfaction of both parents and families. The progressive
          muscular weakness leads to the development of scoliosis soon after the child has become
          unable to walk. The muscular weakness and scoliosis also affect the pulmonary function of
          these children. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) have been used to determine "pulmonary
          fitness" prior to surgery as a way to determine how well or if the child will tolerate
          surgery. Children with poor results on the PFT are determined to be too fragile to tolerate
          such a large operation. The physicians conducting this study feel that the PFT may be
          inaccurate and that this may not be the best single test to determine "pulmonary fitness".
          The physicians conducting the study think things like the time of day the study is done, how
          tired you are when you complete the test, and how well you understand the test may affect
          the results of the test.
