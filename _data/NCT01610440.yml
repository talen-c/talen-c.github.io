  Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked recessive genetic disease always progressed
          slowly，tends to leading proximal skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness of limbs, as well as
          impaired respiratory muscle and cardiac muscle. To a large extent, patients always lose
          motor function gradually and die for heart failure or severe infection at the end stage of
          DMD. At present, the treatment strategy relies on heteropathy accompanied with
          rehabilitation training. However, the therapeutic effect remains extremely limited.

          Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have been evidenced to improve motor
          function, increase muscle strength and reduce abnormal levels of related enzymes, such as
          creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
          aspartate aminotransferase (AST). This study is aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of
          hUC-MSCs transplantation for DMD.
