  textblock: |-
    The life span in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has been extending due to the
          development of artificial respiratory devices. According to that, the ratio of cardiac
          dysfunction as a cause of death has been increasing. This cardiac dysfunction was associated
          with minor cardiac damage as indicated by elevation of plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI).
          Furthermore, and the detection rate of cTnI plasma as revealed to be correlated with the
          deterioration speed of LV dysfunction assessed by serial echocardiography measurements.
          Accordingly, if this minor cardiac damage is suppressed, it is postulated that the
          progression of cardiac dysfunction can be stopped. In the cases with ventricular arrhythmia
          and tachycardia, we found plasma cTnI became undetectable after administration of
          beta-blocker. Accordingly, we investigate whether administration of beta-blocker, carvedilol
          can persistently suppress the minor cardiac damage and lead to suppress the deterioration of
          LV function. Note that his study preventive study for preserved to moderate LV dysfunction
          and is not intended to the beta-blocker treatment for severe LV dysfunction. Because we
          assume that the mechanism of elevation of cTnI is different; spontaneous in preserved to
          mild LV dysfunction in patients but LV wall stress in severe LV dysfunction in patients with
          Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

    Purpose This cardiac dysfunction in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated
          with minor cardiac damage as indicated by elevation of plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The
          purpose of this study is to investigate whether the administration of Carvedilol can
          suppress the minor cardiac damage and prevent deterioration of cardiac function.
