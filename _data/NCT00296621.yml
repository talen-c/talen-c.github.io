    Glutamine inhibits whole body protein degradation in children with Duchenne Muscular
          Dystrophy (DMD). The effect is observed after 5 h oral glutamine administration and is also
          found when glutamine is given over a 10-day period. This multi-site national study aims to
          evaluate the functional benefit of long-term oral glutamine administration in 30 DMD
          children using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. The study
          includes two 4-month periods: 1) a treatment period in which the subject receives oral
          glutamine (0.5 g/kg/d) and 2) a control period in which the subject receives a placebo. The
          order of treatment allocation is randomized. The two 4-month periods are separated by a 1
          month wash-out period. The children are monitored every 2 months during period 1 (M0, M2,
          M4) and period 2 (M5, M7, M9) in the clinical investigation centres of Hospital Robert Debré
          in Paris and the CHR&U de Lille, as well as the clinical research centre of the CHU de
          Poitiers. Evidence of a functional benefit would involve evaluating the administration of
          glutamine over longer periods (as early as possible following diagnosis) among severely
          handicapped children and in other chronic pathologies associated with increased muscle
          protein catabolism. In DMD, such evidence would enable children to undergo gene therapy
          under improved physical condition.

          Comparisons: Glutamine administration compared to placebo on the following outcome measures:
          walking speed on a standard course, work (kcal) and power (kcal/s) in relation to effort,
          body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis and BIPHOTONIC absorptiometry), muscle
          mass (24-h urinary creatinine excretion), indices of protein degradation (CPK and 3-methyl
          histidine excretion) and biochemical parameters (electrolytes, fasting glucose,
          transaminases, insulin, IgfI, Igf-BPI).
