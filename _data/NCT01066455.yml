    The research study will include 50 participants aged 8 to 18 years old (before 18th
          birthday) with Duchenne, Becker, or autosomal recessive limb-girdle (specifically: LGMD
          2C-2F and 2I) muscular dystrophies.

          Participants will be seen in one of five Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research
          Group (CINRG) centers located in the United States.

          All study assessments will be completed in the same day and include reviewing past medical
          and surgical history, collecting vital signs, collecting cardiac measures through
          echocardiographic tests.
