      Inclusion Criteria:

                1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a mutation correctable by treatment with
                   PRO045 confirmed by a state-of-the-art DNA diagnostic technique covering all DMD gene
                   exons, including but not limited to MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe
                   Amplification), CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation), SCAIP (Single Condition
                   Amplification/Internal Primer) or HRMCA (High-Resolution Melting Curve Analysis), and
                   correctable by PRO045-induced DMD exon 45 skipping in cultured skin-derived
                   myo-converted fibroblasts.

                2. Ambulant boys aged at least 5 years on the day of first dosing able to walk for at
                   least 230 meters in the 6 minute walking distance (6MWD) test at first screening
                   visit and also at the baseline visit. In addition, 2 of the 3 pre-treatment 6MWD
                   tests (screen 1, screen 2, baseline) must be within +/-30 metres of each other prior
                   to first PRO045 administration.

                3. Adequate quality for biopsy (confirmed with MRI) of the lateral head of the
                   gastrocnemius muscle. An alternative muscle may be considered for biopsy but only
                   following discussion between the Principal Investigator and the Prosensa Medical
                   Monitor.

                4. Life expectancy of at least 3 years after inclusion in the study.

                5. Glucocorticosteroid use which is stable for at least 3 months prior to first PRO045
                   administration. Subjects must have been receiving glucocorticosteroids for at least 6
                   months prior to the first PRO045 administration.

                6. Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
                   requirements.

                7. Written informed consent signed (by parent(s)/legal guardian and/or the subject,
                   according to the local regulations).

                8. In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either
                   affiliated to, or a beneficiary of, a social security category.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                1. Known presence of dystrophin in ≥5% of fibres in a pre-study diagnostic muscle biopsy
                   (i.e. historic muscle biopsy taken prior to written informed consent for this study).

                2. Current or history of liver disease or impairment.

                3. Current or history of renal disease or impairment.

                4. At least two aPTT above ULN within the last month.

                5. Screening platelet count below the lower limit of normal (LLN).

                6. Acute illness within 4 weeks prior to first dose of PRO045 which may interfere with
                   the study assessments.

                7. Severe mental retardation or behavioural problems which in the opinion of the
                   investigator prohibits participation in this study.

                8. Severe cardiomyopathy which in the opinion of the investigator prohibits
                   participation in this study. If a subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction
                   <45% at screening, the investigator should discuss inclusion of the subject with the
                   Medical Monitor.

                9. Expected need for daytime mechanical ventilation within the next year.

               10. Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents.

               11. Use of idebenone or other forms of coenzyme Q10 within 1 month prior to the start of
                   the screening for the study.

               12. Use of nutritional or herbal supplements which, in the opinion of the investigator,
                   may influence muscle performance, within 1 month of the study.

               13. Use of any other investigational product or participation in another trial with an
                   investigational product, within 6 months prior to the start of the screening for the
                   study.
