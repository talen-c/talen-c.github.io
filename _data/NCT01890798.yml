      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Prior DMD114876 subjects: Subjects who completed both the 24 week double-blind
                   treatment and 24 week post-treatment phases in study DMD114876, OR Subjects who
                   withdrew from the treatment portion of study DMD114876 due to meeting laboratory
                   safety stopping criteria may be eligible to enroll in the extension study if: the
                   laboratory parameters that led to stopping have resolved; benefit of further
                   treatment with drisapersen outweighs the risk to the individual subject; and
                   following consultation with the GSK Medical Lead.

                -  Prior DMD115501 subjects:

                -  Active subjects who entered into open-label extension study DMD115501. Subjects are
                   required to be withdrawn from DMD115501 to participate.

                -  Prior DMD114044 Subjects: US citizens who completed study DMD114044 in another
                   country and who want to return to the US to participate, upon agreement by a
                   physician conducting this protocol, OR Unites States citizens who participated in
                   DMD114044 but who had to withdraw from the study due to meeting laboratory safety
                   stopping criteria may be eligible to enroll if: the laboratory parameters that led to
                   stopping have resolved; benefit of further treatment with drisapersen outweighs the
                   risk to the individual subject; and following consultation with the GSK Medical Lead
                   and upon agreement of physician conducting this protocol

                -  Prior DMD114349 Subjects: US citizens who participated in and completed study
                   DMD114044 in another country and who entered into the ongoing open-label extension
                   study DMD114349 in a country outside the US who wish to withdraw from DMD114349 and
                   return to the US to participate in this protocol, upon agreement by a physician
                   conducting this protocol. Subjects are required to withdraw from DMD114349 to
                   participate in this protocol.

                -  Baseline platelets of 150 x 109/Liters (L) or greater and no history of
                   thrombocytopenia.

                -  Continued use of glucocorticosteroids for a minimum of 60 days prior to protocol
                   entry with a reasonable expectation that the subject will remain on steroids for the
                   duration of the protocol. Changes to or cessation of glucocorticosteroids will be at
                   the discretion of the physician conducting this protocol in consultation with the
                   subject/parent. The GSK Medical Lead must be notified in a timely manner.

                -  Willing and able to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures (with the
                   exception of those assessments requiring a subject to be ambulant, for those subjects
                   who have lost ambulation).

                -  Able to give informed assent and/or consent in writing signed by the subject and/or
                   parent(s)/legal guardian (according to local regulations).

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Subject had a serious adverse experience or who met safety stopping criteria that
                   remains unresolved from protocol DMD114876, which in the opinion of the physician
                   conducting this protocol could have been attributable to study medication, and which
                   is ongoing. Once resolved, subject may be eligible to enroll following consultation
                   with the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Lead.

                -  Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents, or previous treatment
                   with investigational drugs, except for drisapersen, within 28 days of the first
                   administration of drisapersen.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    This is a single arm, open-label continued access protocol of drisapersen for the treatment
          of male subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) having dystrophin mutations
          correctable by drisapersen-induced DMD Exon 51 skipping. The purpose of this continued
          access protocol is to offer pre-approval access to drisapersen for the treatment of subjects
          with DMD who previously participated in eligible drisapersen studies. The protocol will
          collect safety data required to assure subject safety and periodic efficacy data on muscle
          function.
