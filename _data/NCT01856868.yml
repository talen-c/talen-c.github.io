brief_title: Use of (-)-Epicatechin in the Treatment of Becker Muscular Dystrophy
  (Pilot Study)
biospec_descr: {}

  mesh_term:
  - Muscular Dystrophies

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    (-)-Epicatechin will be evaluated for the treatment of progressive muscle loss and impaired
          skeletal muscle function in Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) patients. This is a
          proof-of-concept phase 1/2a pilot and endpoint development study that is designed to provide
          initial evidence of biological activity of (-)-epicatechin. Primary endpoints include
          initial assessment of tissue-specific evidence of efficacy from muscle biopsy samples.
          Secondary endpoints include measures of strength and physical function, and safety and
          adverse event data. Pilot endpoints include assessment of mRNA and miRNA peripheral blood
          profiles and validation of non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) muscle perfusion
          studies during exercise and a recumbent cycle exercise test that may be employed as
          endpoints in future clinical trials.

          This single center open-label pilot study will enroll 10 adults with genetically-confirmed
          Becker muscular dystrophy, who will receive the purified nutritional extract (-)-epicatechin
          100mg/day orally for 8 weeks. After screening visits, participants will be enrolled in the
          study if they meet all inclusion criteria. They will be evaluated at baseline and at
          screening, day 1, and weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8.
