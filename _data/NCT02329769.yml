    A Phase II, open-label, extesion study. Following a Screening period of up to one month,
          subjects previously treated with PRO044, and eligible for enrolment in PRO044-CLIN-02, will
          be allocated to one of three groups to receive either 6 mg/kg or 9 mg/kg PRO044 weekly by IV
          infusion or 6 mg/kg weekly by SC injection for 48 weeks.

          Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and efficacy
          assessments will be conducted at regular intervals throughout the study.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                1. Subjects previously treated with PRO044.

                2. Continued use of glucocorticoids for a minimum of 60 days prior to study entry with a
                   reasonable expectation that the subject will remain on steroids for the duration of
                   the study. Changes to the dose regimen or cessation of glucocorticoids will be at the
                   discretion of the Principle Investigator (PI) in consultation with the subject/parent
                   and the Medical Monitor. If the subject is not on steroids, involvement in the study
                   needs to be discussed with the medical monitor

              Exclusion Criteria:

                1. Current, or history of, liver or renal disease.

                2. Acute illness within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of PRO044 (Week 1) which may
                   interfere with the measurements.

                3. Severe cardiac myopathy which in the opinion of the Investigator prohibits
                   participation in this study

                4. Need for daytime mechanical ventilation.

                5. Screening aPTT above the upper limit of normal (ULN).

                6. Screening platelet count below the lower limit of normal (LLN).

                7. Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents.

                8. Use of any investigational product within 6 months prior to the start of Screening
                   for the study.

                9. Current or history of drug and/or alcohol abuse.
