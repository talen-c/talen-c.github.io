    The study will enroll boys with nonsense mutation DBMD who have a history of exposure to
          ataluren in a prior PTC study in nmDBMD (PTC124-GD-004-DMD, PTC124-GD-004e-DMD,
          PTC124-GD-007-DMD, PTC124-GD-007e, and PTC124-GD-008-DMD) at a trial site in the US.
          Patients will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Study
          assessments will be performed at clinic visits during screening and every 12 weeks until the
          end of the study. Patients must also return to the clinic for a post treatment visit 6 weeks
          after the last dose of ataluren.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is
          caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining
          normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads
          to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type
          of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in
          approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
          investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense
          mutation. This study is an open-label trial for patients with nonsense mutation
          dystrophinopathy who received ataluren in a prior PTC-sponsored study at a US clinical trial
          site. This trial will be conducted at sites in the US and will evaluate the long-term safety
          of ataluren, as determined by adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.
