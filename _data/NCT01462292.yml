    Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) suffer from a relentless, progressive and fatal
          disease due to lack of dystrophin, a critical muscle protein. There is currently no known
          cure for the disease. GSK2402968 is thought to correct several genetic mutations through
          skipping of exon 51 and therefore targets only those boys with these mutations.

          A reasonable hypothesis is that increasing dystrophin will result in clinical improvement,
          and that the amount of dystrophin expressed will correlate with clinical improvement above a
          threshold level (e.g. around 30% of control). The initial limited efficacy data from
          completed and ongoing unblinded studies with GSK2402968 are encouraging as they have
          demonstrated de novo production of dystrophin and improved walking ability (primary efficacy
          endpoint) after 48 weeks of treatment which has been generally well tolerated.

          This study is designed to explore the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of two doses of
          GSK2402968 given over 24 weeks. The two doses to be assessed are 6mg/kg/week and
          3mg/kg/week. Based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, it is predicted at
          steady-state that the 6 mg/kg/week dose will induce dystrophin expression greater than 30%
          of control. The 3 mg/kg/week dose was chosen as modeling predicts 3 mg/kg/week of GSK2402968
          will produce dystrophin expression in the range of 18-22%. Potential variability between
          subjects could theoretically produce higher expression and lead to a dystrophin level
          correlated with clinical improvement.

          Following the treatment period, the study has a 24 week post-treatment phase. The purpose of
          the post-treatment phase is to model the half-life of dystrophin, assess maintenance of
          response, and provide information about resolution of adverse event and laboratory
          abnormalities following cessation of treatment.
