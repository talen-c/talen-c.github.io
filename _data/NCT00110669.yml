    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common lethal inherited disorder worldwide.
          Despite the exponential increase in our understanding of the disorder since the discovery
          and characterization of the causative gene and its product dystrophin in 1987, current
          therapeutic management remains largely supportive. Awaiting a final genetic cure to be
          available in the future, further investments in developing better drug therapies for DMD
          remain important. The effect of a high dose prednisone regimen will be evaluated in
          comparison to a daily dose regimen in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind
          placebo-controlled 4-arm study. Ambulant children aged 4-10 years with an established DMD
          diagnosis will be studied. Patients will undergo 2 screening evaluations within 1 week.
          Patients will be randomized into treatment groups on the second screening visit, followed by
          a 12-month treatment period. During the treatment period, patients will be evaluated at
          monthly intervals. The primary endpoints are percentage change in average muscle strength
          score and QMT performance for specific muscle groups. Secondary endpoints include timed
          function tests, functional grades for arms and legs, and pulmonary function tests.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    This study will help to determine whether a high-dose weekly course of prednisone therapy is
          safer than and at least as effective as daily dose therapy for people with Duchenne muscular
          dystrophy (DMD). Boys who are enrolled in this study should not have taken carnitine, other
          amino acids, creatine, glutamine, Coenzyme Q10 or any herbal medicines within the last three
          months. There will be a two-visit screening to take place in one week to ensure a
          reproducible manual muscle test. The subject will then be randomized and put into either the
          daily or weekly regimen. The duration of the study is twelve 28-day treatment cycles
          (approximately 12 months) with follow-up visits at month one, three and then every three
          months.
