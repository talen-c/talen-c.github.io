    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal disease of progressive muscular weakness for
          which there is currently no effective treatment. The disease is caused by mutations in the
          gene for dystrophin. A subset of these mutations includes nonsense mutations, i.e.,
          premature stop codons. Previous studies have shown that aminoglycosides are effective in
          allowing translation through stop codons. Recently, gentamicin was shown to restore
          functional dystrophin in a mouse model of DMD. The objective of this protocol is to
          determine if gentamicin is also an effective treatment in patients with DMD caused by
          nonsense mutations. This will be a preliminary, non-blinded study in which levels of
          intravenous gentamicin previously established to be safe, will be administered to identified
          patients meeting inclusion criteria over a two-week period. These patients will have CLIA
          approved laboratory documented stop codon mutations in the dystrophin gene. Quantitative
          dystrophin expression will be the primary outcome. Strength measurements will also be
          assessed before and immediately after the two-week treatment period. Follow-up evaluations
          will be made at one month. For this subset of patients with DMD it is anticipated that there
          will be a transient increase in dystrophin expression with a possible corresponding
          transient improvement in strength. Subsequent blinded studies to evaluate the most effective
          dose and dosing intervals would then be pursued.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    This study will evaluate the antibiotic gentamicin for treating patients with muscular
          dystrophy caused by a specific genetic abnormality known as a nonsense mutation. In studies
          of mice with this type of muscular dystrophy, gentamicin treatment produced positive changes
          in muscle tissue.

          Patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy caused by nonsense mutations by may be
          eligible for this 2-week study. Before starting treatment, patients will have evaluations of
          muscle strength and general well being. Two muscle tissue samples will be taken by needle
          biopsy, under local anesthetic and sedation. Because of potential risks of hearing loss and
          kidney toxicity associated with gentamicin, patients will also have a hearing test and blood
          and urine tests for kidney function before starting treatment. (Currently, gentamicin is
          commonly prescribed for serious infections of the lungs, heart, and digestive and urinary
          tracts; adverse effects of hearing loss and kidney toxicity can occur with excessively high
          drug doses.)

          Patients will be hospitalized during drug treatment. Gentamicin will be given intravenously
          (through a vein) once a day for 14 days. Blood samples will be collected daily to monitor
          drug levels and determine dosage adjustments, if necessary. Urine samples will be collected
          to assess kidney function. Hearing tests will be done on days 7 and 10.

          On the last day of the study, hearing, kidney function, and muscle strength will be tested
          and the results compared with pre-treatment levels. Blood and muscle samples will also be
          taken again for pre-treatment comparison. Hearing, blood, urine, and muscle strength tests
          will be repeated one month after treatment ends for comparison with previous results.
