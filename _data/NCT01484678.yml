    The overall objective of this proposal is to validate the potential of noninvasive magnetic
          resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor disease progression and to serve
          as an outcome measure for clinical trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is one
          of the most devastating genetically linked neuromuscular diseases and is characterized by
          the absence of dystrophin, resulting in progressive muscle weakness, loss of walking ability
          and premature death. Despite the poor prognosis for patients with muscular dystrophy,
          therapeutic interventions have been lacking, and outcome measures for clinical trials have
          been limited to measures of muscle function, serum biomarkers of muscle breakdown and
          invasive muscle biopsies. Additional quantitative outcome measures that are noninvasive and
          sensitive to changes in muscle structure and composition are needed to facilitate the rapid
          translation of promising new interventions from preclinical studies to clinical trials. As
          such, this proposal targets the development and validation of magnetic resonance as a
          noninvasive biomarker of disease progression in muscular dystrophy. Using a multi-site
          research design this study will examine the intramuscular lipid content, muscle
          damage/inflammation and contractile area in the lower extremity muscles of 100 ambulatory
          boys with DMD and 50 healthy age matched boys using a combination of MRI and MRS
          technologies. In order to assess the sensitivity of each MR measure to disease progression,
          all boys with DMD will be reevaluated in yearly or 6 month intervals. In addition, the
          investigators will correlate changes in MR measures with standard measures of disease
          progression, such as loss in muscle strength and functional ability. Using MRI/MRS the
          investigators will also examine the effect of initiating corticosteroid treatment on
          skeletal muscle characteristics and composition. Finally, the investigators will deposit
          immortalized fibroblasts from carefully characterized DMD boys participating in this study
          in established tissue repositories.

          The investigators anticipate that the MR techniques developed and validated in this proposal
          will be suitable for clinical trials in a wide range of muscular dystrophies and other
          neuromuscular diseases. In addition, MR characterization may serve as a powerful tool to
          further advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and help guide
          the design of future trials.

      Subjects will be recruited from across the country as well as locally. The investigators
              have established a website (www.imagingDMD.org) and advertise the study nationally through
              list serves.The study will also be advertised at the website of non-profit DMD
              organizations. General information will be emailed to faculty and colleagues around the
              country. Fliers and brochures will be distributed in participating local clinics, MDA
              clinics, schools, and local pediatric clinics, and in strategic locations in associated
              hospitals. Age-matched healthy boys will be recruited from the families of the local DMD
              population as well as the university community. Parents of eligible subjects will be asked
              to contact the site clinical coordinator, who will complete a telephone screening
              interview to assess eligibility.

    The purpose of this research study is to determine the potential of magnetic resonance
          imaging to monitor disease progression and to serve as an objective outcome measure for
          clinical trials in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The investigators also hope to learn
          more about the changes that occur in muscles of the lower leg in boys with DMD.

          The investigators will compare the muscles of ambulatory boys with DMD with muscles of
          healthy children of the same age and monitor disease progression in boys with DMD over a 5
          year period. The amount of muscle damage and fat that the investigators measure will also be
          related to performance in daily activities, such as walking and the loss of muscle strength.
          In a small group of subjects the investigators will also assess the effect of corticosteroid
          drugs on the muscle measurements.
