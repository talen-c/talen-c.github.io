  detailed_description: 
    textblock: "This is a multicenter, observational study of patients receiving Translarna based on\n      inclusion of their data in a registry. This study is intended to enroll 200 patients across\n      ~50 care centers in Europe and other regions over a period of ~ 2 years. The study\n      population will include patients who are receiving usual care treatment with commercial\n      supply of Translarna (or receiving care within a named patient early access program) and who\n      provide consent. Patients will be followed for at least 5 years from their date of\n      enrollment. Safety and efficacy data will be collected in conjunction with routine visits\n      conducted as per usual care. Although there are no protocol-mandated procedures, it is\n      expected that physicians and other caregivers will follow published treatment guidelines and\n      standards of care."
