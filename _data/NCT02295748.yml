    This is an open label, long-term extension study in approximately 24 male DMD subjects
          consisting of children (ages 4-12, inclusive) and adolescents (ages 13-16, inclusive) who
          participated in the MP-104-CL-005 PK study.

          Subjects may have received up to 8 (+2 days) doses of deflazacort during the MP-104-CL-005
          PK study, at which point treatment will be continued at the same dose and frequency until
          such time that deflazacort becomes commercially available or the study is terminated.
          Concomitant corticosteroid therapy will be prohibited during the study while the subject is
          taking deflazacort.

          Subjects will be given medication to take at home for once-daily, morning dosing following
          the 8 hour PK sample on Day 8 (+2 days) of the MP-104-CL-005 PK study. Subjects will begin
          dosing at home the day following Day 8 (+2 days) of the MP-104-CL-005 PK study.

          Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory
          evaluations every 3 months for the first year, and then every 3 or 6 months, depending on
          subjects' disease status.

          Subjects will be contacted via telephone between study visits to determine if any adverse
          events (AE) have occurred since the last study visit. Subjects who terminate the study early
          will be contacted if the Principal Investigator (PI) deems necessary.

          Treatment will be continued for a maximum of three years or until such time that deflazacort
          becomes commercially available or the study is terminated.

  description: Deflazacort, a glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive
    effects, is used in treating a variety of diseases. Pharmacologically it is an
    inactive pro-drug which is metabolized rapidly to the active drug 21-desacetyldeflazacort.

                -  Subject is capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements.

                -  Subject or, when applicable, the subject's legally acceptable representative signs

                   (IAF) and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study
                   procedures. Subjects under age 7 at the time of study entry who turn age 7 will sign
                   and date a written informed assent form (IAF) at the visit following their 7th
                   birthday, if required by the site's IRB.

                -  Subject participated in and received at least one dose of study medication in the
                   MP-104-CL-005 protocol.

                -  The subject must have confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy defined as:

                     1. onset of weakness before 5 years of age;

                     2. proximal muscle weakness;

                     3. increased serum creatine kinase more than 10 times the upper limit of normal
                        (ULN);

                     4. muscle biopsy and dystrophin analyses consistent with DMD or DNA mutation and
                        analysis by PCR or Southern blot techniques to detect gene deletions.

                -  The subject weighs at least 13 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) of â‰¤ 40 kg/m2.

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, oral drug administration,
                   and study procedures including blood sample draws for safety labs.

                -  Up to date on all childhood vaccinations, including varicella vaccine (chicken pox).

                -  Baseline health is judged to be stable based on medical history, physical
                   examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs, or ECGs at screening, as deemed by the
                   Investigator.
