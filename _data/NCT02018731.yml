    This is a single center, not-randomized open study. The study medication consists of
          L-citrulline and metformin administered orally; 5g citrulline and 500mg metformin tablets
          will be given 3 times daily.

          Half of the patients will be treated with metformin during the first 6 weeks of the study.
          The other patients will receive initially L-citrulline for 6 weeks, before all patients will
          be treated with the combination therapy (metformin and L-citrulline) for another 6 week
          period.

          The study lasts 12 weeks and includes the screening visit and 3 further visits at baseline,
          week 6 and week 12.
