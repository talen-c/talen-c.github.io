    This trial is designed to define drug interactions following the combined administration of
          Isosorbide Dinitrate, a NO donor, and ibuprofen, NSAID, a through pharmacokinetics approach.

          Both ibuprofen and Isosorbide Dinitrate were licensed worldwide. Ibuprofen is approved for
          use in adults and children; Isosorbide is approved for use in adults. Ibuprofen is currently
          used in pediatric patients as a first line anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent.
          Consensus exists that among NSAIDs ibuprofen is the one endowed with less adverse effects
          (see note 66 of the Italian Drug Agency AIFA and MEA). No specific studies concerning safety
          and tolerability of ISDN in pediatric patients have been reported.

                -  Any Gastrointestinal conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
                   interfere with the absorption of the drug or render the subjects unable to take oral
                   medication (gastric ulcer, peptic ulcer, stomach acid, frequent diarrhea,
                   gastrointestinal surgery)

    This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics plasma profile of 3 treatments: ISO 20, IBU
          200 and IBU and ISO combinations (200 +20) given in single dose.

          This study is being conducted to support the submission for new indication in treatment of
          the combinations of Isosorbide Dinitrate and Ibuprofen as a treatment for Duchenne muscular
          dystrophy.
