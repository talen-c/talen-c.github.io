    We propose to compare the reliability of CQMS vs. HHM in the DMD population. The importance
          of this study is to be able to compare the results of clinical trials done by different
          networks using distinct strength endpoints. If results indicate a distinct difference in
          reliability of one tool over the other, a standardized tool could be established for
          research groups throughout the world to interpret strength in the context of clinical
          trials. If the results indicate minor differences then it would be possible to interpret and
          compare/contrast strength measurements used in different studies.

          Understanding the relationship between the HHM vs CQMS will help us examine other surrogate
          measures capable of predicting functionality that are based on strength measurements.

  description: Muscle groups will be tested in a standardized order 1. Knee extension
    2. Knee flexion 3. Elbow Flexion 4. Elbow extension with all tests sequencing
    following a right to left pattern. This will reduce assessment bias and the impact
    of muscle fatigue per muscle group. Study participants are randomized to two different
    sequences of four assessments, one sequence performed on one testing day (Visit
    1) and another on a different testing day (Visit 2).
  measure: Compare the inter and intra rater reliability of HHM and CQMS by measuring
    Elbow and Knee Flexor/Extensor Strength in children ages 6-18 diagnosed with DMD
    tested by experienced clinical evaluators in both HHM and CQMS.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The aim of the proposed research is to compare two commonly used pediatric strength testing
          measures: handheld myometry (HHM) and CINRG Quantitative Measurement System (CQMS), with the
          goal of identifying a sensitive and valid tool for measuring muscle strength in children
          with DMD. The data obtained from this study will be used to make recommendations for
          strength measurement endpoints in prospective muscular dystrophy trials and provide more
          reliable and accurate recommendations in the clinic for strength assessment. This study will
          be performed at six participating sites in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular
          Research Group (CINRG).
