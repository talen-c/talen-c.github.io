      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Non-ambulatory;

                -  Quadriceps muscle strength of MRC (Medical Research Council Scale) grade 3 or below

                -  Any subject who is between 3 to 8 years of age must have received at least two doses
                   of influenza vaccine last season or at least one dose tow or more years ago.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Subject must not have a history of severe reactions following previous immunization
                   with influenza vaccine.

                -  Subject must not have previously received a 2011-2012 influenza vaccine.

                -  Subject must not have a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome.

                -  Subject must not have received a live viral vaccine (i.e., MMR, varicella) within 28
                   days prior to receipt of the study vaccine.

                -  Subject must not have any condition that the investigator believes would render
                   vaccination unsafe or interfere with successful completion of the study.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The purpose of the study is to compare the immune response of two different injection
          methods (Intramuscular V.S. Subcutaneous) of the 2011-2012 seasonal Influenza (Flu) vaccine
          among patients with neuromuscular conditions who have significant muscle degeneration. This
          research study hypothesizes that the subcutaneous route of vaccine administration, as
          compared to the intramuscular route, may confer at least comparable, or possibly better,
          immunogenicity. At least 30 individuals followed by the CCHMC Neuromuscular Comprehensive
          Care Center will be recruited to participate in this study lasting approximately one to two
          months with two clinic visits and one follow-up telephone call. Immunogenicity will be
          assessed by comparing hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers obtained pre- and
          post-vaccination.
