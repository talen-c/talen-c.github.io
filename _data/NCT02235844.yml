  textblock: |-
    This research study is designed to evaluate the effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal
          stem cells (UC-MSCs), on Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD). The potential muscle
          regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties of UC MSCs position them as a possible
          treatment option for DMD. Both of these properties could lead to potential benefits for a
          DMD patient.
