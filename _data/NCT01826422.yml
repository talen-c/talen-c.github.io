  textblock: |-
    DMD and DMB are X-linked diseases caused by mutations in the DMD gene, these mutations have
          important functional and structural consequences in skeletal muscle. In muscle fiber is
          observed inflammation and necrosis as a result of lost regenerative capacity. The muscle
          fibers can be replaced by connective and adipose tissue. In a previous study the
          investigators identified that 50% of Duchenne and Becker patients in the range of thirteen
          years old have obesity. In addition, these patients (N=66) have hyperinsulinemia (53.7%) and
          insulin resistance (48.5%). It is well known that obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin
          resistance have a inflammatory background.

          It has been demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic fatty acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic fatty
          acid (DHA) exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and have beneficial effects on obesity,
          hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in children and adolescents.

          Objective: Determine the effect of EPA and DHA on inflammation, obesity and insulin
          resistance in patients with DMD/DMB compared to those receiving placebo.
