secondary_outcome:
- safety_issue: 'No'
  time_frame: 18 months
  description: This test will measure the time it will take to run/walk 50 meters.
    It has not been typically used in clinical trials as a timed test measure, however,
    may be a more sensitive test measure in the very young cohort to assess functional
    strength as it measures a longer distance to run compared to the 10 meter walk.
    Preliminary analysis in a small pilot cohort indicates that it is better correlated
    with other functional assessments such as the North Star Ambulatory Assessment.
  measure: Time to walk/run 50 meters
- safety_issue: 'No'
  time_frame: 18 months
  description: The NSAA is a clinician rated 17-item functional scale originally designed
    for ambulant boys with DMD who are able to ambulate at least 10 meters. This evaluation
    tool assesses functional activities including standing, getting up from the floor,
    negotiating steps, hopping, and running. The assessment is based on a 3-point
    rating scale of 2= ability to perform the test normally, 1= modified method or
    assistance to perform test, 0=unable to perform the test. Thus, total score can
    range from 0 (completely non-ambulant) to 34 (no impairment) on these assessments.
    NSAA has shown good reliability and validity in multi-center studies as well as
    good clinical validity demonstrated with Rasch analysis.

primary_outcome:
- safety_issue: 'Yes'
  time_frame: 18 months
  description: The primary outcome will measure safety and tolerability by tabulating
    number of adverse events occuring in patients in each treatment group. Adverse
    events are specified in the protocol and relate to excess weight gain, inadequate
    linear growth, elevated blood pressure, worsening scores on behavior scales, declining
    heart rate variability and abnormalities of circadian rhythm of sympathetic tone.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease for which no
          curative treatment has yet been identified, making it important to slow progression and
          improve the quality of life among affected boys and young men. Treatment with
          corticosteroids is standard of care for patients with DMD five years old and older, due to
          the robust observation that this intervention lengthens the interval prior to loss of
          ambulation but is associated with many side effects. This clinical trial will be conducted
          in the youngest age group able to receive corticosteroids orally and on whom study outcomes
          are measurable, ages 3 to 7 years. This is a randomized, double blinded, double masked,
          placebo-controlled clinical trial that will explore whether better synchronization of
          corticosteroid administration with the circadian rhythm will provide improved tolerability
          and at least comparable efficacy to current standards in which corticosteroids are always
          given in the morning. Furthermore, the trial provides a unique opportunity to rigorously
          evaluate corticosteroid effects in the young DMD patient, both for efficacy as compared to
          placebo and as a study of the impact of corticosteroid chronotherapy, or delayed release, on
          increased tolerability over standard therapy. The main hypothesis is that synchronization of
          the timing of corticosteroid dosing will improve medication tolerability in children, while
          maintaining (non-inferiority) the efficacy of corticosteroid. The study also offers a unique
          opportunity to measure several biomarkers as well as novel genetic modifiers that may
          further impact the response to corticosteroid in DMD.
