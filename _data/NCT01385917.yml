  criteria:
    textblock: |-
      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy confirmed by genetic testing and a muscle
                   biopsy (dystrophin expression < 5%), theoretically treatable by exon 53 skipping.

                -  Age between â‰¥ 6 and <20 years old.

                -  Patient capable of sitting upright in a wheelchair for at least one hour.

                -  Patients covered by a national health insurance scheme.

                -  Signed informed consent.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Patient incapable of sitting upright in a wheelchair for at least one hour.

                -  Patients with severe intellectual impairment preventing them from fully understanding
                   the exercises to be performed.

                -  Recent (less than 6 months ago) upper limb surgery or trauma This criteria is however
                   no definitive. Patients who have undergone upper limb surgery or trauma may
                   nonetheless be enrolled once the 6 month period is over.

                -  Known immune deficiency.

                -  Contraindications to NMR exams
