brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The purpose of Part A of the Phase 1/2 ascending multiple-dose, open-label study is to
          evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CAT-1004 in pediatric patients with a
          confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). CAT-1004 is an orally administered
          small molecule targeted to inhibit activated NF-ÎºB, a molecule that is activated from
          infancy in DMD and which is central to causing muscle damage and preventing muscle
          regeneration. Data on magnetic resonance imaging of the lower and upper leg muscles,
          physical function (including timed function tests) and muscle strength will be collected at
          baseline. Dose escalation between cohorts will only occur after patients in the prior cohort
          have completed dosing and data have been evaluated by the Sponsor, Investigator and an
          independent data safety monitoring board (DMSB). The intention is that enrolled patients, if
          eligible, will return for additional treatment with CAT-1004 in a randomized,
          placebo-controlled, 12-week Part B study, which is anticipated to be submitted as a protocol
          amendment.
