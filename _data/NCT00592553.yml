    This study is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
          dose-ranging, efficacy and safety study, designed to document the clinical benefit of PTC124
          when administered as therapy of patients with DMD/BMD due to a nonsense mutation (premature
          stop codon) in the dystrophin gene. It is planned that ~165 boys who are at least 5 years of
          age and can walk at least 75 meters (80 yards) will be enrolled. Study subjects will be
          enrolled at sites in North America, Europe, Israel, and Australia. They will be randomized
          in a 1:1:1 ratio to either a higher dose of PTC124, a lower dose of PTC124, or placebo.
          Subjects will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for 48
          weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at clinic visits every 6 weeks. Additional safety
          laboratory testing, which may be performed at the investigational site or at an accredited
          local laboratory or clinic, is required every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks of the study.
          At the completion of blinded treatment, all compliant participants will be eligible to
          receive open-label PTC124 in a separate extension study.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Ability to provide written informed consent (parental/guardian consent if
                   applicable)/assent (if <18 years of age)

                -  Age ≥5 years.

                -  Phenotypic evidence of DMD/BMD based on the onset of characteristic clinical symptoms
                   or signs (ie., proximal muscle weakness, waddling gait, and Gowers' maneuver) by 9
                   years of age, an elevated serum creatinine kinase level, and ongoing difficulty with
                   walking.

                -  Documentation of the presence of a nonsense point mutation in the dystrophin gene as
                   determined by gene sequencing from a laboratory certified by the College of American
                   Pathologists (CAP), the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act/Amendment (CLIA) or an
                   equivalent organization.

                -  Confirmed screening laboratory values within the central laboratory ranges (adrenal,
                   renal, and serum electrolytes parameters)

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
                   study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                   study treatment.

                -  Initiation of systemic corticosteroid therapy within 6 months prior to start of study
                   treatment or change in systemic corticosteroid therapy (eg, initiation, change in
                   type of drug, dose modification not related to body weight change, schedule
                   modification, interruption, discontinuation, or reinitiation) within 3 months prior
                   to start of study treatment.

                -  Any change (initiation, change in type of drug, dose modification, schedule
                   modification, interruption, discontinuation, or reinitiation) in
                   prophylaxis/treatment for congestive heart failure within 3 months prior to start of

                   vanilla, Cab-O-Sil® M5P [colloidal silica], magnesium stearate).

                -  Exposure to another investigational drug within 2 months prior to start of study
                   treatment.

                -  History of major surgical procedure within 30 days prior to start of study treatment.

                -  Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy (other than corticosteroids).

                -  Prior or ongoing medical condition (eg, concomitant illness, psychiatric condition,
                   behavioral disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings,
                   electrocardiogram findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's
                   opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the subject, makes it unlikely that the
                   course of treatment or follow-up would be completed, or could impair the assessment
                   of study results.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It
          is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for
          maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility
          that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A
          specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of
          DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. PTC124 is an orally delivered,
          investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense
          mutation. This study is a Phase 2b trial that will evaluate the clinical benefit of PTC124
          in boys with DMD/BMD due to a nonsense mutation. The main goals of the study are to
          understand whether PTC124 can improve walking, activity, muscle function, and strength and
          whether the drug can safely be given for a long period of time.
