    Detailed Description:

          DMD is a progressive degenerative muscle disorder for which there is no current cure.
          Glucocorticoids (GC) are often used to improve motor function and survival but have
          significant side effects such as growth failure, weight gain, insulin resistance and
          osteoporosis. IGF-1 stimulates both the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle
          cells and is thus important for muscle repair and regeneration. IGF-1 offers potential as a
          therapeutic agent for DMD as it may improve or preserve motor function and reduce GC side
          effects such as growth failure and insulin resistance.

                   biopsy

                -  Proximal pelvic girdle weakness (Gower's maneuver, difficulty with arising from floor
                   and going up steps)

                -  Male

                -  Age > 5 years of age

                -  Ambulatory

                -  Informed consent

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures

              Exclusion Criteria:

                   the opinion of the investigators, to affect muscle function, need to have been
                   started 3 months prior to enrollment

                -  Patients enrolled in other clinical drug trials

                -  Any physical or mental conditions which may, in the investigators'opinions, render
