    A 1.25 mg-test dose will be administrated to assess the treatment tolerance before
          randomization. A forced titration of nebivolol and placebo will be performed with 2 weeks
          periods. Full dose of nebivolol and placebo is 5mg/day (7.5mg/day for patients whose weight
          is>60kg).

    The objective is to determine whether nebivolol, a beta-blockade drug, can prevent the
          development of heart disease in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged 10 to 15
          year-old.
