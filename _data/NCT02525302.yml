    As a follow-on study to the initial clinical studies of HT-100 in DMD (Protocols HALO-DMD-01
          and HALO-DMD-02), this open-label study is designed to provide data on continuous long-term
          dosing. Subjects will be entered into the study without cessation of dosing, in a staggered
          fashion, into the same cohort assignment they had in the predecessor studies. Up to 30
          subjects who have completed dosing in HALO-DMD-02 will be offered the opportunity to
          continue on the same dose regimen until market approval of HT-100 or termination of the
          study by the Sponsor. Reasons for termination could include, among others, safety concerns
          or lack of efficacy, based on analysis of combined data from all HT-100 studies. Safety data
          from subjects approaching the end the HALO-DMD-02 participation will be individually
          reviewed by the Medical Monitor and the subject's physician (Principal Investigator [PI]).
          If the Medical Monitor and the PI agree there are no clinically significant safety signals
          (absence of clinically significant laboratory or clinical abnormalities to date), the
          subject will be considered eligible and offered continuation of dosing. To avoid an
          interruption in dosing, subjects will immediately be screened for participation and enrolled
          upon completing the predecessor trial, HALO-DMD-02. Participation is in this study
          HALO-DMD-03 is optional. Safety and pharmacodynamics (PD) monitoring will continue
          throughout the subject's study participation. Dose reduction/modification might occur or
          individual subjects' participation in the trial may be discontinued if any Adverse Events
          (AEs) suggest that HT-100 is not sufficiently well tolerated.

    This study, HALO-DMD-03, is a follow-on study to HALO-DMD-01 and HALO-DMD-02, and allows
          continued open-label access to HT-100 for subjects who have completed these studies.
          HALO-DMD-03 will provide safety and strength and function data on continuous long-term
          dosing. Data from this study will be used to inform the safety, tolerability, and dose
          selection for a future trial of HT-100 in boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).
