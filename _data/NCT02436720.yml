    This is a multicentric study involving a large number of patients that could not be
          collected in a single Unit.

          The aim of the project is to collect a large number of patients that will allow to assess
          the suitability of different measures assessing upper limb function. As DMD is a relatively
          rare condition, such goal can only be reached in a multicentric setting. All the
          participating centres (Rome Gemelli, Messina, Rome Bambin Gesù, Pavia, Genoa, Naples, Turin,
          Bologna, Padua, Milan, Bosisio Parini, Pisa) have a good record of cooperation in similar
          projects having already been involved in the validation of the North Star in DMD and of the
          Hammersmith Functional motor Scale for SMA.

          The projects will be developed through different steps, related to different specific aims:

            1. Interobserver reliability/quality and quantity of training One of the aims of the study
               is to assess reliability of the selected measures in a multicentric setting and the
               quantity of training required to be sure of the reliability among observers after the
               training sessions. Following our experience in the training of the North Star
               Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) in the same network, the investigators have become aware
               that a single training session may not be sufficient to be sure that interobserver
               reliability will be maintained after the training sessions (Mazzone et al, 2009).

            2. Natural history data collection The PUL will be applied to the whole cohort with
               repeated assessments at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months . This will allow to monitor possible
               changes over time and the rate of changes in patients with different level of ability
               and age. This will also help to evaluate the responsiveness to change and the level of
               sensitivity of the measure over an interval that would be useful for a study of a
               putative agent that could improve muscle power.

            3. Correlation with other measures Another aim of the study is to relate possible changes
               in upper limb function with other measures of care and function such as the EK scale,
               that provides information on aspects of function, such as transfer or self feeding that
               are important in everyday life. Correlation with respiratory function will also be
               performed.

            4. improving statistical properties of the scales. There has been increasing evidence in
               the last few years that Rasch analysis may help to improvethe statistical properties.
               The data collected will offer the opportunity to perform these new psychometric
               techniques.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The literature on outcome measures assessing upper limbs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy
          (DMD) is quite scanty. While there have been considerable advances for ambulant DMD boys, no
          prospective study has so far been devoted to outcome measures in non ambulant patients, with
          increasing complaints from families and patients. This information appears to be highly
          important not only for a better understanding of the progression of the disease but also for
          possible enrollment of patients in future trials.

          The aim of this project is to identify outcome measures for non ambulant patients in an
          Italian population of DMD patients. At least 200 non ambulant DMD boys and adults will be
          included in the study. All patients will be assessed using the newly developed Performance
          of Upper limb (PUL) test. This measure will be used at baseline and 6 and 12 months after
          baseline. This will allow to monitor possible changes over time and the rate of changes in
          patients with different level of ability and age. As part of this study the investigators
          will also correlate possible changes in upper limb function with other measures of care and
          function such as the EK scale.

          The investigators aim to assess the suitability of the individual measures in a large number
          of patients, trying to establish whether whole scales or individual items appear to be
          relevant across ages and level of abilities. The investigators also aim to assess the
          suitability of the selected measures in a multicentric setting and the quantity of training
          required The data collected will also be analysed using Rasch analysis in order to improve
          the statistical properties of the measures used.
