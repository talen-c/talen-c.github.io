      This is a single-centre, prospective, observational, study on clinical outcomes of
              testosterone replacement therapy in adolescents with DMD and delayed puberty. Being an
              observational study of routine care, there will be no specified end point. We will aim to
              recruit any adolescent with DMD and delayed puberty who is reviewed by the muscle team at
              the John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre from the study approval date.

                -  Anticipated surgery during the study period.

                -  Symptomatic cardiac failure.

                -  Participants/families who may have emotional or psychological problems if recruited

                -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, including
                   arachis oil or derivatives (including hypersensitivity and allergy to peanuts or
                   soya.)

                -  Any contra-indication to receiving an intramuscular injection

                -  Any additional chronic disease that affects androgen production

                -  Anti-coagulant therapy

                -  If participation in the study is not recommended in the opinion of the investigators

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    "Observational study of clinical outcomes for testosterone treatment of pubertal delay in
          Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy" is a single centre observational study that aims to follow the
          progress of 20 adolescents with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and delayed puberty who
          are treated by the Newcastle muscle team, as they are treated with testosterone to induce
          puberty. The participants will all be treated with the standard stepwise regimen of
          testosterone injections every 4 weeks and data will be collected to help determine the
          effectiveness and tolerability of the current treatment regimen. The investigators will use
          the data to explore the effect of testosterone on pubertal development, growth, muscle
          strength and function, bone mineral density and body composition and characterise any side
          effects. Semi-structured interviews will also be carried out to learn the boys' views on the
          tolerability of the regimen. The study will last up to a maximum of 27 months in total for
          each participant, but may be less if they are happy with pubertal development before this
          time. It is important to do this study because from the investigator's limited experience in
          this group, testosterone treatment seems to be well liked and tolerated but the best
          treatment regimen to use remains unknown and there is no current consensus. It is not
          currently part of the standard of care in DMD but it would be important to include it if
          this study can show that it is an effective treatment for pubertal delay.
