      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Patients 8 - 16 years of age at time of enrolment

                -  Male

                -  Presence of cardiac involvement/dysfunction, defined by abnormal peak systolic strain
                   in left ventricle (LV) inferolateral wall

                -  Confirmed diagnosis of DMD (out of frame dystrophin gene deletion OR absent/<5%
                   dystrophin protein on muscle biopsy; clinical picture consistent of typical DMD)

                -  If on chronic glucocorticosteroids treatment (deflazacort, prednisone) for DMD (or
                   any other disease) (i.e. concomitant medication): dosage must be stable (unchanged) 6
                   months prior to inclusion

                -  If on chronic medication for DMD associated cardiomyopathy (Î²-blocker, diuretics):
                   dosage must be stable (unchanged) 3 months prior to inclusion

                -  Ability to provide reproducible repeat quantitative muscle testing (QMT) upper limb
                   score within 15% of first assessment score (at Visit1/Day 1 versus Screening Visit

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or heart failure

                -  Asymptomatic but severe cardiac dysfunction on baseline (Screening) evaluation:
                   Fractional shortening (FS) < 20% and/or Ejection fraction (EF) < 40%

                -  Use of ACE-inhibitors

                -  Previous history of ventricular arrhythmias (other than isolated ventricular
                   extrasystole); ventricular arrhythmias presented at Screening

                -  Previous (6 months or less) participation in any other therapeutic trial for DMD

                -  Use of coenzymeQ10, idebenone, creatine, glutamine, oxatomide, or any herbal
                   medicines within the last 6 months

                -  History of significant concomitant illness or significant impairment of renal or
                   hepatic function

    Assessing the peak systolic radial strain of the left ventricle inferolateral wall is used to characterize the cardiac involvement in the DMD patients.
    Color Doppler Myocardial Imaging technique is used to quantify regional myocardial function.
    The cardiac involvement in DMD is characterized by degeneration, atrophy and fibrosis of the myocardium, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. The process begins in the posterolateral wall of the left ventricle, with septal involvement appearing at later stages.

    (LV) Inferolateral Wall From Baseline (at Screening) to Week 52, Assessed by Color
    Doppler Myocardial Imaging (CDMI).

        Assessing the peak systolic radial strain of the left ventricle inferolateral wall is used to characterize the cardiac involvement in the DMD patients.
        Color Doppler Myocardial Imaging technique is used to quantify regional myocardial function.
        The cardiac involvement in DMD is characterized by degeneration, atrophy and fibrosis of the myocardium, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. The process begins in the posterolateral wall of the left ventricle, with septal involvement appearing at later stages.

  textblock: |-
    Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10 and is a powerful antioxidant and
          essential constituent of the process of energy production on the cellular level. It can
          protect mitochondria from oxidative damage and boost their impaired function. It is thought
          that this mechanism will slow decline in heart function that is part of the disease process
          of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). It is possible that patients may benefit in terms of
          muscle strength and respiratory function. This pilot trial is designed to investigate this.
