    We will utilize the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research group (CINRG) network
          to collect cohorts of Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) patients with in-frame deletions in
          the dystrophin gene. We will collect clinical data across multiple body systems and
          correlate these findings to the high-resolution deletion break-point mapping performed from
          the tissue samples. We will investigate the observed variability to deepen our understanding
          of molecular mechanisms relevant to the optimization of exon skipping therapeutic
          approaches.

    This is a multi-center natural history study that will be conducted at participating centers
          in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG). Following a baseline
          evaluation, participants will have three follow-up visits over a three-year period. The
          investigators will characterize the Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype, and correlate
          specific abnormal dystrophin proteins with the range of clinical outcomes.
