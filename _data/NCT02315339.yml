    The data (baseline and follow-up) should be collected as part of routine clinical care. In
          clinical practice, after HMV initiation, the first control examination (follow-up number
          one) with nocturnal diagnostics should take place within the first 4-8 weeks. Annual
          follow-up is required, and it is recommended that subsequent control visits should be
          performed 1-2 times a year. Each patient will be included for 5 years (total duration of the
          registry).

      The registry will target all adult individuals who have an indication for HMV (including
              those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], central hypoventilation syndrome [CHS],
              chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], kyphoscoliosis, obesity hypoventilation
              syndrome [OHS], spinal cord injury [SCI], Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD], muscular
              dystrophies [MDs] other than DMD, myopathies and myotonic dystrophy [Steinert's muscular
              dystrophy; SMD]). All newly-diagnosed patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are
              eligible for HMV treatment as part of routine care can be included in the registry.
              Patients who satisfy all the inclusion criteria will be consecutively enrolled into the
              registry.
  criteria:

      Inclusion Criteria:

                   care

                -  Patient is able to fully understand the study information and is willing to give
                   informed consent

                -  Patient, or the patient's legal guardian, signing the consent form

              Exclusion Criteria:

              - No exclusion criteria have been defined because only data from routine clinical care are

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The European Home Mechanical Ventilation Registry (EHMVR) will enable a thorough evaluation
          of HMV by documenting the characteristics of HMV patients and their treatment. This will
          facilitate a prospective, observational study to identify the primary indications for HMV,
          describe patterns of HMV use in European countries, and characterize changes in the
          initiation and utilization of HMV over time. The registry will target all adult individuals
          who have an indication for HMV. In the EHMVR, patient data from routine clinical care will
          be documented using an electronic case report form (eCRF). The eCRF will record: patient
          demographic data; diagnostic information (including primary diagnosis, 6-minute walk time,
          the presence of depression, and quality of life); blood gases; ventilation treatment
          (including type of ventilator, modes and settings, interfaces used); follow-up data
          (including failure rates, side effects, technical issues). An initial Pilot Phase will be
          launched with the aim to enrol at least 200 patients over a 6-month period to determine the
          feasibility of the registry. Steering committee members and their institutions will be the
          main participants in the Pilot Phase. After completion of the Pilot Phase, the registry will
          be expanded across Europe with the goal of enrolling approximately 10,000 patients over 5
          years.
