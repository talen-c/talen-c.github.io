    Muscular dystrophy is a group of inherited disorders that involve muscle weakness and loss
          of muscle tissue, which get worse over time. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a
          defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles). However, it often occurs in people
          without a known family history of the condition. slowly progress diseases.it causes Muscle
          weaknesses, Difficulty with motor skills ,Progressive difficulty walking.Breathing
          difficulties and heart disease,Frequent falls,weak limbs,lose motor Function.Begins in the
          legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other areas of the
          body.Trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs.
