    This phase I randomized double blind dose escalation study investigates the safety and
          efficacy of the mini-dystrophin gene transferred to the biceps muscle for Duchenne muscular
          dystrophy patients, ages 5 to 12 years of age, using a recombinant adeno-associated virus.
          Eligible participants must have a known dystrophin gene mutation and may be concurrently
          treated with corticoid steroids. The mini-dystrophin gene or a placebo agent (normal saline
          or empty viral capsids) are injected directly into both biceps muscles while under conscious
          sedation. Following the gene transfer, patients are admitted to the hospital for 48 hours of
          observation followed by weekly outpatient visits at the Columbus Children's Hospital
          Neuromuscular Clinic. A bilateral muscle biopsy is preformed following 6 weeks with long
          term follow up will consisting of bi-annual visits for the next 2 years.
