    This protocol represent an open randomized and prospective trial, designed to answer the
          specific question regarding the role of the cardioprotective therapy in Duchenne Muscular
          Dystrophy and Becker Muscular Dystrophy patients. In this light, CMR could provide relevant
          data, reinforcing the scientific background, to start early (particularly in BMD patients in
          whom this is still a debated question) a cardioprotective treatment with carvedilol or
          ramipril.Finally,this clinical trial will clarify whether a preventive therapy may be
          helpful on the clinical outcome, both in reducing myocardial fibrosis and preventing the
          progression towards the cardiomyopathy.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                1. Immunohystochemical and molecular diagnosis of Duchenne and Becker muscular
                   dystrophy.

                2. Not evidence of clinical cardiomyopathy,normal 2D-echocardiography with normal
                   systolic,WMSI = 1) and diastolic function.

                3. DMD patients treated with steroid therapy.

                4. All DMD and BMD patients are not treated with cardiological therapy (ACE-inhibitors,
                   ARBs or Beta-Blockers).

                5. Written informed consent to study participation (with serial visit, CMR and
                   echocardiographic study) is required from all patients themselves, as well as their
                   parent or guardian and healthy-control subjects.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                1. Failure to obtain informed consent from patients, parents or guardians.

                2. Any controindications to carvedilol or ramipril treatment (bronchial asthma,
                   diabetes, any degree of renal failure (all patients are required to have a normal
                   creatinine level and clearance).

                3. in BMD patients ECG changes suggestive of ischemic heart disease, left bundle-branch
                   block, atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, any degree of
                   atrioventricular block and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Aspecific ST changes
                   will be not considered as electrocardiographic exclusion criteria both in DMD and BMD
                   patients.

                4. In BMD patients exclusion criteria will be also hypertension and valvular heart
                   disease other than trivial.

                5. DMD and BMD patients requiring ventilatory (non-invasive or invasive) assistance.

                6. Presence of systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction detected by 2D-Echocardiography.

                7. Presence of any contraindications to CMR (including any history of claustrophobia).

                8. Patients under the age of 2 years.

                9. Renal failure, even mild.

               10. Patient unable or unwilling to attend the follow-up and tests, in the opinion of
                   local study principal investigator, (children not willing to perform CMR will not be
                   enrolled).

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Data on preventive therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular
          dystrophy (BMD) affected individuals without cardiac involvement are very limited and
          currently lacking regard both ACE-inhibitors and Beta-Blockers in Becker Muscular Dystrophy
          and for the latter even in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients. Thus, the study aim is to
          compare the efficacy of carvedilol vs ramipril on myocardial tissue properties and heart
          function, performing CMR and myocardial Ultrasound Tissue Characterisation analysis.
