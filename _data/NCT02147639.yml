    There are 2 phases to this research project: (1) an initial baseline study to confirm the
          blood flow abnormality in Becker muscular dystrophy, and (2) a subsequent brief treatment
          trial. There are also 3 optional study protocols: (A) dose-escalation trial, (B) placebo
          trial, and (C) increased exercise intensity trial.

          The baseline study involves an intake history, physical examination, and phlebotomy for
          blood chemistries and DNA followed by non-invasive forearm blood flow studies (Near Infrared
          Spectroscopy, Doppler Ultrasound) before and after a brief bout of handgrip exercise
          (approximately 3-5 hours to complete). Blood flow studies will be performed with the
          subject's lower body enclosed in an airtight chamber. Blood flow and oxygen delivery to the
          forearm muscles will be measured before and during application of lower body negative
          pressure at rest and during handgrip exercise. Lower body negative pressure simulates the
          blood flow changes that normally occur when a person sits up after lying down.

          The results of the baseline study will determine which patients meet preset eligibility
          criteria to participate in the medication phase of the study. These criteria include (1)
          normal kidney and liver function tests and normal BNP levels (the latter to exclude heart
          failure), and (2) abnormal blood flow responses to handgrip exercise.

          Eligible patients will be asked to repeat the above laboratory procedures on a subsequent
          study day after receiving a single dose of sodium nitrate. Eligible patients will also be
          offered the option to repeat the above laboratory procedures on three subsequent study
          visits, where upon: (A) the dose of sodium nitrate is increased, (B) a placebo is ingested,
          and/or (C) the level of exercise in increased.

          The investigators plan to enroll 20 adult men with Becker muscular dystrophy.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    This study is intended to build on a growing body of literature showing a blood flow
          abnormality in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy. The investigators' laboratory
          recently showed that this blood flow abnormality could be corrected by a single oral dose of
          the drug Tadalafil (also known as Cialis). The investigators now wish to replicate these
          exciting results using a common nitric oxide donor (sodium nitrate).
