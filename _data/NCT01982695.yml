brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    This trial is a double-blind randomized clinical trial of lisinopril versus losartan for the
          treatment of cardiomyopathy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Both drugs are known to be
          effective for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. ACEi have been reported to delay the
          onset and progression of left ventricle dysfunction in children with DMD. Multiple studies
          show therapeutic efficacy of losartan in animals with cardiomyopathy related to muscular
          dystrophy and in patients with cardiomyopathy from diverse causes. ARBs are often reserved
          for patients in whom heart failure is not adequately treated or where side effects preclude
          the use of an ACEi. However, in DMD, losartan might be a better choice as a first line drug
          because of studies demonstrating a potential benefit for skeletal muscle in the mdx mouse.
          Considering that both skeletal and cardiac muscles are major contributors of the disability
          of DMD, a drug that could improve both heart and skeletal muscles simultaneously would need
          consideration as the drug of choice for the cardiomyopathic DMD patient.
