    This Phase 2a, multicenter, open-label safety and efficacy study will be performed at 3
          sites in the United States. The study will enroll up to 38 subjects with nonsense mutation
          Duchenne muscular dystrophy who participated in a previous Phase 2a study of ataluren
          (Protocol Number PTC124-GD-004-DMD). Subjects will receive study drug 3 times per day (at
          breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for approximately 96 weeks (approximately 2 years). Study
          assessments will be performed at clinic visits during screening, every 6 weeks for the first
          24 weeks, and then every 12 weeks until the end of the study. Additional safety laboratory
          testing, which may be performed at the investigational site or at an accredited local
          laboratory or clinic, is required every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 6
          weeks from Week 24 to Week 48. Subjects will have a biceps muscle biopsy before ataluren
          treatment and again after 24 weeks of ataluren treatment to evaluate changes in muscle
          dystrophin expression. An evaluation of the effects of ataluren on corticosteroid
          pharmacokinetics will be performed. Associated with this ataluren clinical trial is a
          substudy that will use magnetic resonance evaluations to assess changes in the composition
          of muscles of the legs.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is caused
          by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal
          muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to
          weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type of
          mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DMD in
          approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
          investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense
          mutation. This study is a Phase 2a extension trial that will evaluate the long-term safety
          of ataluren in boys with nonsense mutation DMD, as determined by adverse events and
          laboratory abnormalities. The study will also assess changes in walking, muscle function,
          strength, and other important clinical and laboratory measures.
