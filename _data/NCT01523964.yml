    Healthy subjects and subjects with DMD will be screened during Visit 1. Screening
          evaluations will establish eligibility and will include a medical history, abbreviated
          physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and respirations),
          and weight. Eligible subjects will provide assent, as stipulated by Institutional Review
          Board (IRB) requirements, and a parent/guardian will sign an informed consent, after which
          the subject will be considered enrolled.

          Subjects will be enrolled into 4 study cohorts for a total of approximately 90 subjects.
          Allocation into these cohorts is planned due to considerations regarding the effect of age
          on outcomes.

          Visit 2, Study Assessments, may take place on the day of Visit 1 screening evaluations. If
          the subject cannot complete study assessments on the same day, the subject may return and
          complete Visit 2 evaluations within approximately 24 hours of the end of Visit 1.

          Visit 2 assessments will include morphological testing of muscle length and girth, skin fat
          measurement, Clinical Assessments (6-Minute Walk Test [6MWT], North Star Ambulatory
          Assessment, timed function tests, dynamometry), and 3 phases of Device Performance testing.
          Phase 1 Device Performance testing will be done by each of 2 trained raters (Rater A and
          Rater B) from the research site, designated to perform the Device Performance testing on all
          subjects at their respective site. At least 10 minutes after completion of the first
          assessments, Phase 2 Device Performance testing will be repeated by Rater A. Upon completion
          of the Phase 2 Device Performance testing, the subjects will proceed with Clinical
          Assessments performed by a physical therapist. Following Clinical Assessments, Phase 3
          Device Performance testing will be performed by Rater B.

      Inclusion Criteria:

              DMD Subject Cohorts

                -  Male subjects

                -  Subjects with a chronologic age of 3 to 7 years inclusive for Cohort A, and 8 to 12
                   years inclusive for Cohort B

                -  Subjects with DMD diagnosed with mutational testing and/or absence of dystrophin on
                   muscle biopsy

                -  Subjects with proximal pelvic girdle weakness (Gower's maneuver, difficulty with
                   arising from floor and going up steps)

                -  Subjects who can walk 10 meters unassisted (ie, without braces, canes, or other aids)

                -  Subjects who are taking systemic corticosteroids and/or any other medication which,
                   in the judgment of the investigator, could impact muscle strength or physical
                   activity levels, must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of
                   study measurements

                -  Subjects who provide assent, as stipulated by IRB requirements, and whose
                   parent/guardian signs an informed consent form

                -  Subjects who are willing and able to cooperate and comply with all protocol
                   requirements and procedures

              Healthy Control Cohort

                -  Healthy males with normal neuromuscular examination

                -  Subjects with a chronologic age of 3 to 7 years inclusive for Cohort C, and 8 to 12
                   years inclusive for Cohort D

                -  Subjects who provide assent, as stipulated by IRB requirements, and whose
                   parent/guardian signs an informed consent form

                -  Subjects who are willing and able to cooperate and comply with all protocol
                   requirements and procedures

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Subjects with daytime ventilatory dependence (non-invasive or tracheostomy)

                -  Subjects enrolled in a DMD therapeutic clinical trial concomitantly or within the
                   past 4 weeks

                -  Subjects with any physical or mental condition which may, in the investigator's
                   opinion, render the subject unable to complete the tasks of the study appropriately

      know to the site staff were approached during clinic visits or by telephone
      to ascertain interest. In addition, referrals from message posted on DMD website
      were included if they met protocol criteria.
    pre_assignment_details: There were no significant events. Subjects were screened
      for eligibility and enrolled.

  textblock: |-
    Physicians seek a method to assess neuromuscular disease that is both non-invasive and
          quantifiable. Many patients do not tolerate standard current day assessment tools (such as
          needle electromyogram), and Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) has the potential to serve
          as a non-invasive, quantifiable, diagnostic tool for neuromuscular disease. If successful,
          these devices will allow for improved ability to diagnose neuromuscular disease and to
          assess disease progression or remission, allowing for better care of individual patients as
          well as for use in clinical trials, where improved outcome measures for neuromuscular
          diseases is being sought.
