    It is planned that this Phase 2a, open-label, safety and efficacy study will be performed at
          5 sites in the US and 1 site in the UK.

          The study will enroll ~30 boys with nonsense mutation DMD/BMD who have been nonambulatory
          for at least one year. Enrollment will be stratified to ensure evaluation of ~15
          participants who are receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy and of ~15 participants who
          are not receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy. Subjects will take ataluren 3 times per
          day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for 48 weeks (~1 year). Study assessments will be
          performed at clinic visits during screening, every 6 weeks for 2 visits and then every 12
          weeks until the end of the study. Additional safety laboratory testing is required 4 times
          during the course of the study; this may be performed at the investigational site, at an
          accredited local laboratory or clinic, or in the subject's home using a nursing service.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It
          is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for
          maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility
          that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A
          specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of
          DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally
          delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the
          nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 2a trial that will enroll boys with nonsense
          mutation DMD/BMD who have lost independent mobility due to the disease. This study will
          evaluate the safety and tolerability of ataluren (PTC124) and will also evaluate efficacy
          outcomes in this patient population.
