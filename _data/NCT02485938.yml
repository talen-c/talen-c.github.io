    Male subjects with cardiomyopathy secondary to DMD meeting all inclusion and no exclusion
          criteria will be enrolled. They will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to either intracoronary
          infusion of CAP-1002 in three coronary arteries supplying the three major cardiac
          territories of the left ventricle of the heart (anterior, lateral, inferior/posterior) or
          usual care.

          All subjects (Groups 1 and 2) assigned to the active treatment arm will receive an intended
          total dose of 75 million (M) CAP-1002 cells infused as 25M cells into each of the three left
          ventricle cardiac territories (anterior, lateral, inferior/posterior). If any of the three
          coronary arteries are deemed by the infusing Investigator to supply less than 30% of the
          left ventricular myocardium, the infusing Investigator may choose to infuse only 12.5M cells
          into that coronary artery or arteries. Should the infusing Investigator deem that one
          coronary artery territory receive 12.5M cells while the other two receive 25M cells, the
          subject will receive a total of 67.5M cells. Should the infusing Investigator deem that two
          coronary artery territories receive 12.5M cells and the third 25M cells, the subject will
          receive a total of 50M cells.

          Subjects randomized to receive usual care will continue to be cared for and treated in
          whatever manner the investigator deems most appropriate for the subject on an ongoing basis,
          and will receive no infusion.

          All enrolled subjects will be followed at Weeks 2 and 6, and at Months 3, 6 and 12 after
          randomization (for usual care arm) or after CAP-1002 infusion (active treatment arm).

    The safety objective of the HOPE-Duchenne trial will be to investigate the safety and
          tolerability of CAP-1002 administered by multi-vessel intracoronary infusion in subjects
          with cardiomyopathy secondary to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

          The efficacy objective of the HOPE-Duchenne trial will be to investigate the efficacy of
          CAP-1002 administered by multi-vessel intracoronary infusion in subjects with cardiomyopathy
          secondary to DMD by stabilizing or improving cardiac structure, by evaluating functional
          status, and by assessment of quality of life.
