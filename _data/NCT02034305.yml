brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    This study is to determine whether physiologic measures (peak cough flow, measures of
          respiratory muscle strength including MIP, MEP ,SNIP, and spirometry) can predict
          spontaneous cough clearance (as measured by a nuclear medicine study) in children with
          neuromuscular disease. It will also determine whether airway clearance is augmented by high
          frequency chest wall oscillation.
