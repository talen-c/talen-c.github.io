brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The main purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of different,
          increasing doses of an experimental medication called HT-100 in boys and young men with
          Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The study medication, HT-100, is a medicine that may help
          promote healthy muscle regeneration, diminish inflammation and the resulting damage to
          muscle, and decrease the scar tissue that forms in the muscles of children with DMD. In this
          study, pharmacokinetic sampling, or measurements of the amount of HT-100 in the bloodstream
          will also be taken.
