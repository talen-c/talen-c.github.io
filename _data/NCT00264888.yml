    In this study, patients with DMD due to a nonsense mutation will be treated with a new
          investigational drug called PTC124. To determine if a patient qualifies for the study
          evaluation procedures will be performed within 21 days prior to the start of treatment;
          these procedures include: history, physical examination, blood and urine tests to assess
          organ function, electrocardiogram (ECG), muscle biopsy for evaluation of dystrophin protein,
          and DMD-specific tests of muscle function (for patients who are able to perform such tests).
          Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study will then participate in a 28-day
          treatment period and a 28-day follow-up period (56 days total). The first 6 patients to be
          enrolled will take PTC124 treatment 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 4
          mg/kg (breakfast), 4 mg/kg (lunch) and 8 mg/kg (dinner); these patients will then be
          observed during a 28-day follow-up period without treatment. Next, 18 additional patients
          will be enrolled to take PTC124 treatment 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of
          10 mg/kg (breakfast), 10 mg/kg (lunch), and 20 mg/kg (dinner); these patients will then be
          observed during a 28-day follow-up period without treatment. Subsequently, 6-12 additional
          patients will be enrolled to take PTC124 treatment 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at
          doses of 20 mg/kg (breakfast), 20 mg/kg (lunch), and 40 mg/kg (dinner); these patients will
          then be observed during a 28-day follow-up period without treatment. There will be a 2-night
          stay at the clinical research center at the beginning and at the end of the 28 days of
          PTC124 treatment. To assess efficacy, patients will have an end-of-treatment biopsy and will
          undergo DMD-specific tests of muscle function (for patients who are able to perform such
          tests). To assess safety and pharmacokinetics, safety assessments, blood and urine tests,
          and ECGs will be performed at prespecified timepoints during the 28-day treatment period and
          the 28-day follow-up period. At the end of the 56 days, patients will be assessed
          periodically regarding their general health status; these evaluations will be performed by
          telephone contact at approximately 6-month intervals in the first 2 years and at
          approximately 12-month intervals in subsequent years (up to 5 years total).

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    In some patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the disease is caused by a nonsense
          mutation (premature stop codon) in the gene that makes the dystrophin protein. PTC124 has
          been shown to partially restore dystrophin production in animals with DMD due to a nonsense
          mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether PTC124 can safely increase
          functional dystrophin protein in the muscles of patients with DMD due to a nonsense
          mutation.
