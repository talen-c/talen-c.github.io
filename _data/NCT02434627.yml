brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The investigators' previous work in males with Becker Muscular Dystrophy shows that
          functional sympatholysis is restored by acute inorganic nitrate supplementation. This was
          translated from work using the mdx mouse model of dystrophinopathy. Recent work has shown
          that there is a frank improvement in grip strength when mdx mice are treated with an
          inorganic Nitric Oxide (NO) donor. The purpose of this study is to determine if chronic
          treatment with an inorganic NO donor can benefit patients with muscular dystrophy beyond
          blood flow regulation.
