brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) often have no severe symptoms of the scelet
          muscles, but they may develop a poor heart function due to the involvement of the heart
          muscle. Ultrasound of the heart is recommended, but it can detect a cardiac affection only
          after the heart has already become weaker. Cardiac magnetic resonance tomography can detect
          myocardial fibrosis already at preserved heart function and may facilitate early therapy. In
          our study, diagnosed carriers of DMD will undergo examinations of the heart by blood tests,
          EKG, heart ultrasound and magnetic resonance at enrollment and after one year in order to
          assess the extent of cardiac affection and its association with the clinical development.
