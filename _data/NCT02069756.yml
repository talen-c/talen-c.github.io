    DuchenneConnect was created in 2007 by Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD), with
          assistance from the NIH, the CDC, and Emory Genetics. In early 2011, PPMD alone began
          financing the registry's operation and maintenance, and is the sole guardian of
          DuchenneConnect and its material.

          Questions may be addressed to the DuchenneConnect Coordinator at telephone 201.937.1408 or
          coordinator@duchenneconnect.org. The DuchenneConnect Coordinator is a certified genetic
          counselor who is available to answer questions regarding the registration process, genetic
          testing and counseling, and clinical trials and research studies.

  textblock: |-
    DuchenneConnect is an online, patient-report registry for individuals with Duchenne and
          Becker muscular dystrophy and carrier females. The purpose of DuchenneConnect is to connect
          Duchenne and Becker patients with actively recruiting clinical trials and research studies,
          and to educate patients and families about Duchenne and Becker care and research. At the
          same time, DuchenneConnect is a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers in academia
          and industry, allowing access to a de-identified, aggregate dataset provided by patients and
          their families—information that is vital to advances in the care and treatment of Duchenne.
          DuchenneConnect is a member of PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research
          Network.
