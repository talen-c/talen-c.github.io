    This study was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
          efficacy and safety study. DMD patients (ambulatory and non-ambulatory) at age 10-18 years
          were enrolled at sites in Europe and North America. Study subjects were randomized in a 1:1
          ratio to receive either idebenone (900 mg/day) or placebo 3 times a day with meals for 52
          weeks. The primary endpoint was the difference between Catena®/Raxone® and placebo in the
          change from Baseline to week 52 in Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF as percent predicted, PEF%p, a
          measure of respiratory muscle strength) as measured by hospital-based spirometry. PEF was
          also measured by the patient at home using the hand-held ASMA-1 device (secondary endpoint).
          Other respiratory endpoints included Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (as percent
          predicted, FEV1%p, an additional measure of respiratory muscle strength) and Forced Vital
          Capacity (as percent predicted, FVC%p, a measure of restrictive lung disease predictive of
          morbidity and mortality in DMD).

      Inclusion Criteria:

                1. Patients 10 - 18 years of age at Baseline.

                2. Signed and dated informed consent.

                3. Documented diagnosis of DMD or severe dystrophinopathy and clinical features
                   consistent of typical DMD at diagnosis (i.e. documented delayed motor skills and
                   muscle weakness by age 5 years). DMD should be confirmed by mutation analysis in the
                   dystrophin gene or by substantially reduced levels of dystrophin protein (i.e. absent
                   or <5% of normal) on Western blot or immunostain.

                4. Ability to provide reliable and reproducible repeat PEF within 15% of the first
                   assessment (i.e. Baseline vs. Screening).

                5. Patients assessed by the investigator as willing and able to comply with the
                   requirements of the study, possess the required cognitive abilities and are able to
                   swallow study medication.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                1. Patients dependent on assisted ventilation at Screening and/or Baseline (defined as
                   non-invasive nocturnal ventilation, daytime non-invasive ventilation or continuous
                   invasive ventilation).

                2. Patients with documented DMD-related hypoventilation for which assisted ventilation
                   is needed according to current standard of care guidelines (e.g. FVC< 30%) or is
                   required in the opinion of the Investigator.

                3. Patients with a percent predicted PEF > 80% at Baseline.

                4. Patients unable to form a mouth seal to allow precise respiratory flow measurements
                   and mouth pressures.

                5. Symptomatic heart failure (high probability of death within one year of Baseline)
                   and/or symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias.

                6. Participation in the previous Phase II or Phase II Extension study (SNT-II-001 or
                   SNT-II-001-E) for idebenone.

                7. Participation in any other therapeutic trial and/or intake of any investigational
                   drug within 90 days prior to Baseline.

                8. Use of carnitine, creatine, glutamine, oxatomide, or any herbal medicines within 30
                   days prior to Baseline.

                9. Use of coenzyme Q10 or vitamin E (if taken at a dose of 5 times above the daily
                   physiological requirement) within 30 days prior to Baseline.

               10. Any previous use of idebenone.

               11. Any concomitant medication with a depressive or stimulating effect on respiration or
                   the respiratory tract.

               12. Planned or expected spinal fixation surgery during the study period (as judged by the
                   investigator).

               13. Asthma, bronchitis/COPD, bronchiectasis, emphysema, pneumonia or the presence of any
                   other non-DMD respiratory illness that affects PEF.

               14. Chronic use of beta-2 agonists or any use of other bronchodilating medication (e.g.
                   inhaled steroids, sympathomimetics, anticholinergics).

                   Please note: Chronic use if defined as a daily intake for more than 14 days.

               15. Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment.

               16. Prior or ongoing medical condition or laboratory abnormality that in the
                   Investigator's opinion could adversely affect the safety of the subject.

                   Please note: Patients who suffer from a severe, unstable condition including (but not
                   limited to) cancer, auto-immune diseases, haematological diseases, metabolic
                   disorders or immunodeficiencies, and who are at risk of an aggravation unrelated to
                   the study condition, can only be included in the study if accepted in writing by the
                   Sponsor's Medical Monitor.

               17. Relevant history of or current drug or alcohol abuse or use of any tobacco/marijuana
                   products/smoking

               18. Known individual hypersensitivity to idebenone or to any of the
                   ingredients/excipients of the study medication

               19. Systemic glucocorticoid therapy

                     1. Chronic use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for DMD related conditions within
                        12 months of Baseline (the "12 month non-use period")

                     2. More than 2 rounds of acute systemic glucocorticoid burst therapy (of ≤2 week
                        duration) for non-DMD related conditions within the 12 month non-use period

                     3. Use of any round of systemic glucocorticoid burst therapy of longer than 2 weeks
                        duration within the 12 month non-use period

    The change from Baseline to Week 52 in muscle strength as measured by Hand-Held Myometry (HHM) was performed following standardized procedures. As almost all patients were non-ambulatory, only analyses of upper limb muscle strength were performed. Results for elbow flexors and for elbow extensors are reported below.The highest value of 3 consecutive measurements with an interval of at least 10 seconds were recorded.
    The HHM was measured using MicroFET2, a digital hand held muscle tester. The selected unit of measure was Newtons (N).

    PedsQL Quality of Life Inventory contains paediatric HRQOL measurements: Physical, Emotional,Social and School Functioning.
    Item Scaling:
    5-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost always). 3-point scale: 0 (Not at all), 2 (Sometimes) and 4 (A lot) for the Young Child (ages 5-7).
    Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 ( 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0) Total Score: Sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales.
    The values reported below are overall scores on Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory in Child/Teen Report. These scores were obtained by averaging scores for all the described subscales. The overall scores range between 0-100 with 0 = worst outcome and 100= best outcome

        The change from Baseline to Week 52 in muscle strength as measured by Hand-Held Myometry (HHM) was performed following standardized procedures. As almost all patients were non-ambulatory, only analyses of upper limb muscle strength were performed. Results for elbow flexors and for elbow extensors are reported below.The highest value of 3 consecutive measurements with an interval of at least 10 seconds were recorded.
        The HHM was measured using MicroFET2, a digital hand held muscle tester. The selected unit of measure was Newtons (N).

    recruitment_details: Recruiting centres were in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands,
      Switzerland, France, Sweden, Austria, Italy, Spain, and the USA. Patients were
      enrolled between July 27, 2009 (study start date), and Dec 14, 2012; the study
      end date (last patient completed the study) was Jan 14, 2014.
    pre_assignment_details: 65 patients were randomly assigned and two patients were
      allocated to the same treatment as their randomly assigned siblings. One patient
      never took study medication, resulting in 66 patients who were treated and included
      in the safety population (34 in the placebo group and 32 in the idebenone group).
