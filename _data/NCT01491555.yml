    Researchers at Children's Hospital Boston Neurology Department invite children to
          participate in a new research study. Researchers are looking for boys age 2 and up with
          Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and healthy boys age 2 and up(without any nerve or muscle
          concerns) to serve as controls. The study is evaluating a new technique that will test nerve
          and muscle function. The testing is all pain free.

          Children participating in the study will come in for 10 visits over two years. Visits will
          take place every month at first, then less often for the remaining visits. The tests for the
          study itself take approximately 2hours. If you are interested or would like to learn more
          about the study, please call Rebecca Parad at 617-355-2752 or
          Rebecca.Parad@childrens.harvard.edu. All inquiries will be kept strictly confidential.
