      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a mutation in the DMD gene, confirmed by a
                   sponsor approved DNA diagnostic technique covering all DMD gene exons, including but
                   not limited to MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification), CGH
                   (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation), SCAIP (Single Condition Amplification/Internal
                   Primer) or H-RMCA (High-Resolution Melting Curve Analysis), and correctable by
                   treatment with GSK2402968.

                -  Age 9 years old or greater at Screening;

                -  Male;

                -  Non-ambulant (at least 1 year in a wheelchair) within the last 4 years;

                -  Life expectancy at least three years;

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures;

                -  QTc <450msec (based on single or average QTc value of triplicate ECGs obtained over a
                   brief recording period). Note: QTc may be either QTcB or QTcF, machine read or manual
                   overread;

                -  Subjects must be willing to use adequate contraception (condoms or abstinence), from
                   Screening until at least 5 months after the last dose of study drug;

                -  Informed assent and/or consent in writing signed by the subject and/or
                   parent(s)/legal guardian (according to local regulations).

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Any additional mutation (such as an additional missing exon for DMD) that cannot be
                   treated with GSK2402968;

                -  Current or history of liver or renal disease;

                -  Acute illness within 4 weeks of anticipated administration of study medication, which
                   may interfere with study assessments;

                -  Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents, previous treatment
                   with investigational drugs, idebenone or other forms of Coenzyme Q10, within 6 months
                   of the first administration of study medication;

                -  Start of glucocorticosteroids within 6 months or non-stable use of
                   glucocorticosteroids within 3 months of the anticipated first administration of study
                   medication;

                -  Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), hepatitis C antibody test (HCV), or
                   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test at Screening;

                -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy;

                -  Use of alcohol from Screening through to the 1 month Follow-up visit ;

                -  Any Child in Care.
