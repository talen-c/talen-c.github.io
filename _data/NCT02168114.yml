    The overall objective of this proposal is to validate the potential of Optical Imaging
          techniques to be able to detect and quantify muscle damage in a population affected by
          Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a muscle wasting disease, and in a healthy population that has
          undergone temporal muscle damage resulting from an exercising intervention.

          Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a relentlessly progressive degenerative muscle wasting
          disease, clinically characterized by progressive muscle weakness, a loss of ambulation, and
          premature mortality. Currently, no known cure exists and treatments that benefit patients
          diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy are limited. New approaches, such as cell
          therapy, gene transfer, and pharmacological interventions have shown promising results in
          animal models and human studies with great potential to develop as effective therapeutic
          treatments. One of the major limitations of testing these interventions; however. is the
          lack of effective methods to monitor cellular and tissue changes taking place in the
          response to therapy. The ability to determine cellular and tissue specific changes in
          damaged muscles in real time, non-invasively, repeatedly, without exposure to any harmful
          radiations, with minimal patient discomfort, and at low operating cost would enable high
          throughput and faster investigation of potential therapies.

          The proposed study focuses on the development of Optical Imaging technologies in the near
          infrared range of wavelengths to differentiate damaged from normal muscle tissue. Near
          infrared light (700 - 900 nm) has demonstrated the ability to deeply penetrate through
          biological tissue, skin, and muscle without appreciable attenuation or auto-fluorescence.

          The investigators anticipate that Indocyanine Green enhanced Optical Imaging can be used to
          image exercise induced acute muscle damage in healthy individuals and damaged muscle and in
          boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It is anticipated that this work may fulfill the need
          for imaging biomarkers that monitor and quantify cellular damage, muscle perfusion, and drug
          delivery - non-invasively, using benign light, repeatedly, and in real time, with the
          intention of accelerating the testing of efficacy in clinical trials for neuromuscular
          disorders. The study is designed to determine the ability of Optical Imaging as a reliable,
          safe, relatively inexpensive, and facile tool to detect and quantify muscle damage.
          Investigators anticipate that this type of imaging modality will provide clinically useful
          information for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in patients with neuromuscular diseases,
          especially boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

    The purpose of this research study is to determine the potential of Optical Imaging
          techniques to detect muscle damage in boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and unaffected
          exercised muscle. Healthy subjects will undergo two different exercises in opposite forearms
          before any imaging techniques are performed. Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will only
          undergo the imaging techniques without exercise.
