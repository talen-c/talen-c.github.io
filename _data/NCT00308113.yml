    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy affecting
          1:3500 male births worldwide. Despite an increase in our understanding of the disorder since
          the discovery and characterization of the causative gene and its product dystrophin in 1987,
          current therapeutic management remains largely supportive. Improvement in the treatment of
          DMD will depend upon the development of better therapies. Affected boys become symptomatic
          at 3 to 5 years of age with proximal leg weakness that impairs mobility, ability to get up
          from a squat, and precludes a normal ability to run. By 8 years of age, some affected boys
          begin to lose the ability to walk and resort to a wheelchair for mobility. This shift from
          the ambulant to non-ambulant phase occurs in all boys with a diagnosis of DMD by age 12
          years. In this study, participants will be randomized into groups after being screened to
          determine eligibility. Participants will then be followed for a 12-month investigation
          period.

    parameters recommending that all patients with DMD should be offered treatment
    with corticosteroids.

  textblock: |-
    This study will help determine if CoQ10 and prednisone, alone and as a combination decrease
          the decline in cardiopulmonary and skeletal muscle function that occurs in the wheelchair
          confined phase of DMD. Participants who are enrolled in this study should not have taken any
          corticosteroids within the last six months. This is a 13-month, prospective, randomized
          study comparing a daily prednisone arm (0.75mg/kg/day), a CoQ10 arm (serum of greater than
          2.5 ug/mL) and a combination arm (prednisone and CoQ10) with an enhanced standard of care
          arm in wheelchair confined males age 10 to 18 years with an established DMD diagnosis.
