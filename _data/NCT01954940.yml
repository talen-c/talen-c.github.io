brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) is a novel, non-pharmacological intervention aimed at
          improving muscle strength and endurance as well as bone density. It holds promise for
          children with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since muscle
          weakness results not only from muscle breakdown but also physical inactivity and muscle
          disuse atrophy. Weak DMD patients may increasingly limit their physical activity due to fear
          of falling or loss of independence (e.g. difficulty rising to stand without assistance).
          Prolonging the length of time boys with DMD are ambulatory is important for delaying
          complications of this disease (lung hypoventilation, scoliosis) as well as maintaining bone
          health. We propose to conduct a pilot study of WBVT in young boys with Duchenne muscular
          dystrophy (DMD). The primary outcome will be to document safety and feasibility of WBVT in
          this patient population. The secondary outcomes will evaluate changes in muscle strength and
          endurance. Bone health will also be examined as part of routine clinical care. The study
          will include 20 ambulatory boys with DMD; patients will be randomized (1:1 allocation) into
          2 groups: WBVT treatment or no WBVT treatment (controls). Treatment groups will consist of
          10 boys undergoing daily WBVT in an 8-week, open-label trial.
