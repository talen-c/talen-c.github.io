    Part 1: Randomized, placebo-controlled dose-titration to assess safety, tolerability and
          pharmacokinetics of 4 dose levels of SRP-4053 in genotypically-confirmed DMD patients with
          deletions amenable to exon 53 skipping.

          Part 2: Open-label evaluation of SRP-4053 in patients from Part 1, along with newly enrolled
          DMD patients with deletions amenable to exon 53 skipping, compared to untreated control DMD
          patients with deletions not amenable to exon 53 skipping.

          Safety, including adverse event monitoring and routine laboratory assessments, will be
          followed on an ongoing basis for all patients.

          Clinical efficacy, including functional tests such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT), will
          be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits. Patients in the treated groups will undergo
          one baseline and one follow-up muscle biopsy. Patients in the untreated control group will
          not undergo biopsies and will follow an abbreviated schedule of study assessments.
