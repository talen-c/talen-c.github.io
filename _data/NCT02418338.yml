    Among the new echocardiographic techniques, two dimensional Speckle Tracking Imaging or "2D
          Strain" allows a dynamic study of regionalized and global ventricular contraction. With
          software for the spatial and temporal processing of a standard 2D image, this technique
          measures the displacement of natural markers present on the myocardial wall.

          Used in adult cardiology since 2000, it could be eligible to pediatric population because of
          many potential applications. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myocardial disease leads to
          death in the third decade. Early diagnosis and preventive therapy remain a challenge. No
          clinic, biologic or radiologic markers can predict myocardial disease before advanced and
          irreversible heart failure.

          Recent animals and human studies suggest that 2D strain anomalies could predict left
          ventricular systolic dysfunction in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. If it is confirmed, 2D
          strain could be used as early marker of myocardial disease in routine patient follow-up and
          in future therapeutic studies.

          Purpose : - To compare systolic function of left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) by
          2D strain evaluation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy children versus a control group.

            -  To correlate 2D Strain variables to conventional LV and RV echo variables.

            -  To evaluate 2D strain feasibility in normal children and Duchenne muscular myopathy
