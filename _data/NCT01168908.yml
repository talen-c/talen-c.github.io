    This clinical trial is focused on cardiovascular disease due to dystrophin deficiency.
          Dystrophin is normally localized to the muscle cell membrane where it interacts with a
          complex of proteins including neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). DMD gene mutations lead
          to the loss of dystrophin and to mislocalization and reduced activity of nNOS, consequently
          reducing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and the activity of its downstream effector,
          protein kinase G. Our group and others have shown that inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5
          (PDE5) leads to favorable cardiac remodeling and improved vascular tone in animal models of
          heart failure.

          This will be a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single center study for
          6 months followed by open-label period of 6 months in which all enrolled subjects receive
          Revatio (a PDE5 inhibitor). A single dose of Revatio (20 mg three times daily) will be
          tested based on the safety and efficacy of that dose for treatment of pulmonary
          hypertension.

          The primary endpoint will be the change in cardiac left ventricular end-systolic volume
          (LVESV) as determined by cardiac MRI after 6 months of Revatio compared to baseline. A 10%
          change in LVESV will be considered significant. This degree of improvement has generally
          been observed in cardiac therapies that improve survival such as ACE inhibitors, beta
          blockers, and cardiac resynchronization. The change from baseline in LVESV after 6 months of
          Revatio will be compared to the change in LVESV over 6 months with placebo. The study will
          extend for an additional 6 months of open-label Revatio to provide data on 6 months versus
          12 months of Revatio treatment. Additional secondary endpoints will include differences in
          systolic and diastolic LV function by MRI, differences in LV mass and fibrosis by MRI,
          brachial flow-mediated vasodilation (peripheral endothelial function), and targeted
          exploratory assessment of differences in skeletal muscle function using forced vital
          capacity (FVC) and pincher and grip testing. Safety will be assessed by differences in the
          frequency and grade of adverse events

          The study is taking place at the Kennedy Krieger Institute/Johns Hopkins Medical
          Institutions in Baltimore, MD. The trial requires out-patient visits over a 12-month period.
          Travel funds, through a grant from Ryan's Quest, are available.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    This study, supported by Charley's Fund, Inc., is being done to determine if the drug
          Revatio®(also known as Sildenafil), as compared to placebo (an inactive substance that looks
          like the study drug, but contains no medication), improves heart function in people with
          Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD).

          In people with DBMD, dystrophin is not present or lacking in heart and muscle. This is
          associated with abnormalities in an enzyme called "neuronal nitric oxide synthase" or nNOS,
          and leads to decreases in "cyclic GMP," which is necessary for proper function of those
          muscles. Revatio blocks an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), and helps to restore
          the normal amounts of cyclic GMP. The purpose of this research is to determine if Revatio is
          safe for people with DBMD and if it can improve heart function.

          Hypothesis : PDE5 inhibition, with the use of Revatio, will improve cardiac function in
          patients with DBMD.
