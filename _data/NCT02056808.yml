    Primary Objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral
          doses of SMT C1100 in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

          Secondary Objectives: To determine the single and multiple oral dose pharmacokinetics of SMT
          C1100 and its metabolites in patients with DMD.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Patients will be males of any ethnic origin with a genetic diagnosis of DMD.

                -  Children between 5 and 11 years of age.

                -  A parent/legal guardian must date and sign a written consent on behalf of the
                   patient, according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and local
                   regulations. This person must understand the contents of the consent, requirements of
                   the study and have had an opportunity to review questions with a medically trained
                   member of the site study team.

                -  The patient is willing to give verbal or written age appropriate assent to
                   participate.

                -  For safety reasons, the patient's parent/legal guardian must have a good
                   understanding of the English language, as this is the only language the
                   consent/assent forms are written in, and understand the requirements for reporting of
                   any adverse event to the Investigator.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Enrollment or participation in any therapeutic clinical trial within the prior 3
                   months or 5 times the half-life (whichever is longer).

                -  Initiation or change (other than dose modifications for body weight) of systemic
                   corticosteroid therapy within 2 months prior to the start of dose administration or
                   discontinuation of corticosteroids within 30 days prior to the start of dose
                   administration.

                -  Known hypersensitivity to the excipients of the study drug or a previous history of
                   drug allergy.

                -  Use of the following therapies is prohibited during the study and for at least 5
                   half-lives prior to the start of dose administration: Inducers of cytochrome P450
                   CYP1A2 (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, rifampin, omeprazole, and
                   barbiturates), and moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine,
                   ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, mexiletine; propafenone, zileuton). Substrates of CYP1A2
                   with narrow therapeutic windows (e.g., tacrine, theophylline, methadone, mexiletine).
                   Nicotine, including exposure to daily passive smoking to minimize cytochrome P450 CYP
                   1A induction. Chargrilled food, cruciferous vegetables, caffeine, tea, and any
                   xanthine containing foods, and drinks are prohibited from 36 hours prior to check-in
                   until final discharge from study. Herbal supplements and homeopathic preparations
                   (unless approved by medical monitor).

                -  Need for mechanical ventilation.

                -  Non ambulatory.

                -  Any clinically significant acute illness within 4 weeks of the start of dose
                   administration.

                -  Any co-morbidity that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risk of
                   participating in the study.

                -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy that in the opinion of the Investigator prohibits
                   participation in this study.

                -  Abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases
                   the risk of participating in the study.

                -  Any clinically significant medical condition, other than DMD that in the opinion of
                   the Investigator may increase the risk of participating in the study or interfere
                   with the interpretation of safety or efficacy evaluations (e.g., concomitant illness,
                   psychiatric condition or behavioral disorder).

                -  Exposure to daily passive smoking (including parent/legal guardian, siblings) so as
                   to minimize environmental factors causing cytochrome P450 CYP 1A induction. For
                   information SMT C1100 is metabolized by cytochrome P450 CYP 1A.

                -  Excessive exercise (Investigator opinion).
