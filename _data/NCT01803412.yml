    In Part A of the study (DMD115501, original protocol), 21 subjects entered the study at 3 US
          sites and completed up to 14 weeks of treatment, and up to 22 weeks of follow-up. This
          protocol amendment, Part B of the study will include up to 13 more US and Canadian centers,
          and up to 51 more subjects. In total the study will enroll approximately 72 subjects. All
          subjects will commence Part B at screening and follow the study schedule.

          The primary dosing arm is drisapersen 6 mg/kg as SC injection(s) once a week. For subjects
          who have previously experienced significant safety or tolerability issues or who experience
          these during the study, there is the potential of an alternate intermittent dosing arm that
          will be given as a regimen of 6 mg/kg/wk for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks off treatment.

          This study does not have a minimum duration of participation. Subjects will have varying
          times of study participation depending on when they enter from one of the eligible studies,
          and will be permitted to continue in this study until such a time that they withdraw based
          on protocol-defined criteria, or Prosensa stops the study.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Participation in an eligible drisapersen study as follows:

              (A) Prior DMD114876 subjects: Subjects who completed both the 24 week double-blind
              treatment and 24 week post-treatment phases in study DMD114876 OR Subjects who withdrew
              from the treatment portion of study DMD114876 due to meeting laboratory safety stopping
              criteria may be eligible to enrol in the extension study if: the laboratory parameters
              that led to stopping have resolved; the principal investigator (PI) considers the benefit
              of further treatment with drisapersen outweighs the risk to the individual subject; and
              following consultation with the Medical Monitor (B) Prior DMD114044 Subjects: US subjects
              who completed study DMD114044 in another country and who want to return to the US to
              participate in study DMD115501, upon agreement by a DMD115501 Investigator OR US citizens
              who participated in DMD114044 but who had to withdraw from the study due to meeting
              laboratory safety stopping criteria may be eligible to enrol in DMD115501 if: the
              laboratory parameters that led to stopping have resolved; the PI considers the benefit of
              further treatment with drisapersen outweighs the risk to the individual subject; and
              following consultation with the Medical Monitor and upon agreement by a DMD115501
              investigator (C) Prior DMD114349 Subjects: US subjects who participated in and completed
              study DMD114044 in another country and who entered into the ongoing open-label extension
              study DMD114349 in a country outside the US who wish to withdraw from DMD114349 and return
              to the US to participate in study DMD115501, upon agreement by a DMD115501 investigator.

              Canadian subjects who participated in the DMD114349 study OR Canadian subjects who
              withdrew from the treatment portion of the study DMD114349 due to meeting laboratory
              safety stopping criteria may be eligible to enroll in the extension study if the
              laboratory parameters that led to stopping have resolved; the PI considers the benefit of
              further treatment with drisapersen outweighs the risk to the individual subject; and
              following consultation with the Medical Monitor.

                -  Continued use of glucocorticoids for a minimum of 60 days prior to study entry with a
                   reasonable expectation that the subject will remain on steroids for the duration of
                   the study. Changes to or cessation of glucocorticoids will be at the discretion of
                   the PI in consultation with the subject/parent and the Medical Monitor. If subject is
                   not on steroids, involvement in the study needs to be discussed with the medical
                   monitor.

                -  Willing and able to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures (with the
                   exception of those assessments requiring a subject to be ambulant, for those subjects
                   who have lost ambulation)

                -  Able to give informed assent and/or consent in writing signed by the subject and/or
                   parent(s)/legal guardian (according to local regulations)

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Subject had a serious adverse experience or who met safety stopping criteria that
                   remains unresolved from studies DMD114876, DMD114044, or DMD114349, which in the
                   opinion of the investigator could have been attributable to study medication, and
                   which is ongoing. Once resolved, subject may be eligible to enrol following PI
                   consultation with the Medical Monitor

                -  Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents, or previous treatment
                   with investigational drugs except for drisapersen, within 28 days of the first
                   administration of study medication

                -  Participation in any other investigational clinical trial within 3 months prior to
                   the start of screening, or during this clinical study. If subject has participated in
                   any other study within 6 months, this should be discussed with the medical monitor
                   prior to study entry.

                -  History of significant medical disorder which may confound the interpretation of
                   either efficacy or safety data (e.g. current or history of renal or liver
                   disease/impairment, history of inflammatory illness)

                -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy. If subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction <45%
                   at Screening, the investigator should discuss inclusion of subject in the study with
                   the medical monitor

                -  A platelet count under the lower limit of normal at screening. A re-test within the
                   screening period is permissible and if within normal range the subject may enter the
                   study.

  textblock: |-
    This is a phase III, multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled extension study in male subjects
          with DMD open to eligible US and Canadian subjects who previously participated in the
          following studies of drisapersen: DMD114876, DMD114044 and DMD114349. Subjects will receive
          6mg/kg drisapersen on a weekly basis. For subjects who have previously experienced
          significant safety or tolerability issues or who experience these during the study, there is
          the potential of an alternate intermittent dosing arm that will be given as a regimen of 6
          mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks off treatment.
