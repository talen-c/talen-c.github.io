    This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
          determine the efficacy and safety of ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg in patients with
          nonsense-mutation (nm) dystrophinopathy. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
          ataluren 10-, 10-, 20-mg/kg dose level or placebo. Patients will receive study drug TID at
          morning, midday, and evening. It is planned that 220 patients will be enrolled and patients
          will undergo 48 weeks of blinded treatment prior to the final analysis. Study assessments
          will be performed at clinic visits every 8 weeks. It is anticipated that an open-label
          extension study will be available to patients (who successfully complete the double-blind
          study) in countries where ataluren is not commercially available.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Ability to provide written informed consent (parental/guardian consent if
                   applicable)/assent per local requirements.

                -  Male sex.

                -  Age ≥7 and ≤16 years.

                -  Phenotypic evidence of dystrophinopathy based on the onset of characteristic clinical
                   symptoms or signs (eg. proximal muscle weakness, waddling gait, and Gowers' maneuver)
                   by 6 years of age, an elevated serum creatinine kinase level, and ongoing difficulty
                   with walking.

                -  Documentation of the presence of a nonsense point mutation in the dystrophin gene as
                   determined by gene sequencing from a laboratory certified by the College of American
                   Pathologists (CAP), the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act/Amendment (CLIA) or an
                   equivalent organization.

                -  Documentation that a blood sample has been drawn for confirmation of the presence of
                   a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene.

                -  Use of systemic corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone, or deflazacort) for a
                   minimum of 6 months immediately prior to start of study treatment, with no
                   significant change in dosage or dosing regimen (not related to body weight change)
                   for a minimum of 3 months immediately prior to start of study treatment and a
                   reasonable expectation that dosage and dosing regimen will not change significantly
                   for the duration of the study.

                -  Ability to walk ≥150 meters unassisted during the screening 6-minute walk test.
                   Patients need to be below the protocol-specified threshold for %-predicted 6MWD.

                -  Results of the 2 Baseline 6MWD results must be determined as valid and results of the
                   Day 2 Baseline 6MWD must be within 20% of the Day 1 Baseline 6MWD.

                -  Baseline 6MWD (mean of valid Day 1 and Day 2 values) must be no more than a 20%
                   reduction from the valid Screening 6MWD.

                -  Confirmed screening laboratory values within the central laboratory ranges (hepatic,
                   renal, and serum electrolyte parameters)

                -  Willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ an approved method of
                   contraception during the period of study drug administration and 6-week follow-up
                   period.

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
                   study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Treatment with systemic aminoglycoside antibiotics within 3 months prior to start of
                   study treatment.

                -  Initiation of systemic corticosteroids therapy within 6 months prior to start of

                   modification not related to body weight change, schedule modification, interruption,
                   or reinitiation) within 3 months prior to start of study treatment.

                   modification,interruption, discontinuation, or reinitiation) in prophylaxis/treatment

                -  Ongoing use of coumarin-based anticoagulants (eg. warfarin), phenytoin, tolbutamide,
                   or paclitaxel.

                -  Prior therapy with ataluren.

                -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of the study drug

                -  Exposure to another investigational drug within 3 months prior to start of study
                   treatment.

                -  History of major surgical procedure within 6 weeks prior to start of study treatment.

                -  Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy (other than corticosteroids).

                   by PTC Therapeutics).

                -  Expectation of major surgical procedure (eg, scoliosis surgery) during the 12-month
                   treatment period of the study.

                -  Requirement for daytime ventilator assistance. Note: Evening ventilator assistance
                   and use of bi-level positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP) therapy is allowed.

                -  Uncontrolled clinical symptoms and signs of CHF (American College of
                   Cardiology/American Heart Association Stage C or Stage D).

                -  Prior or ongoing medical condition (eg, concomitant illness, psychiatric condition,
                   behavioral disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings (eg.
                   lower limb injury that may affect 6MWT performance), ECG findings, or laboratory
                   abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of
                   the subject, makes it unlikely that the course of treatment or follow-up would be
                   completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Dystrophinopathy is a disease continuum that includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which
          develops in boys. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is
          important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes
          muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability. A specific type of
          mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of dystrophinopathy
          in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
          investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense
          mutation. The main goal of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the effect of ataluren on
          walking ability. The effect of ataluren on physical function, quality of life, and
          activities of daily living will be evaluated. This study will also provide additional
          information on the long-term safety of ataluren.
