    Some aspects of the traditional process for the development of new potential therapeutics
          for rare disorders and the ensuing research on safety and efficacy are changing. This is
          due, in part, to the increased ability of families, parents, individuals with rare
          disorders, and advocacy organizations to access and control information, to provide monetary
          or other incentives, and to communicate directly with biopharmaceutical companies and
          clinical investigators. Increasingly, advocacy organizations (and by extension, the families
          they serve) create or participate in disorder registries intended to facilitate research by
          industry and access of families to clinical trials; fund promising bench and clinical
          research; and lobby for outcomes beneficial to drug developers and researchers, such as
          increased funding or facilitated FDA approval. The involvement of families in the research
          process is likely to have implications for how willing individuals are to participate in
          studies, their expectations and perceptions of the study experience, and their behavior
          during the study. Their increased level of involvement may also affect how families perceive
          and respond to a clinical trial in which the results are not as promising as hoped, as
          quickly as hoped. This partnership approach has implications for biopharmaceutical companies
          who sponsor treatment trials and for clinical investigators who lead and implement the
          trials. This qualitative interview study aims to describe, from the perspectives of parents
          of children involved in a clinical trial, research clinicians implementing the trial, and
          the company sponsoring the trial, the experience of this new, more collaborative research
          process. In this case, we will examine the Ataluren trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
          The results from this study are hypothesis-generating for downstream research and can inform
          biopharmaceutical companies and clinician researchers as they plan and implement clinical
          trials for rare disorders and help guide advocacy groups and parent advocates as they
          partner with researchers and industry.

      -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

                -  US residents over 18 years of age who have at least one child with Duchenne Muscular
                   Dystrophy who was enrolled in the phase IIa extension trial or phase IIb trial of
                   PTC124. Participants must be a primary caregiver for their children, must have been
                   involved in deciding whether the child would participate in the clinical trial, and
                   must have accompanied their child to at least one visit to the clinical trial site.

                -  Clinician researchers over 18 years of age who were involved with implementing the
                   clinical trial at a study site.

                -  Representatives of PTC Therapeutics over 18 years of age.

              All participants must be willing and able to complete an approximately 1-hour long
              telephone interview in English.

              EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

              -Must meet inclusion criteria.

    The purpose of this study is to describe the experiences of parents, clinician researchers,
          and industry professionals who were involved in phase II clinical trials of Ataluren for
          Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We are especially interested in learning about motivations for
          being involved in the clinical trial, expectations of the trial, the experience of the
          trial, and relationships between the parents of children involved in the trial, the
          clinician researchers, and PTC Therapeutics. In addition, we would like to learn more about
          whether and how families and advocacy organizations experiences in following the progress of
          the drug, encouraging the clinical trial, and supporting the phase II trials may have
          affected participants thoughts and feelings about the study.
