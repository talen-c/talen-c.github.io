    Phenotyping Study Aims

          Aim 1: Longitudinally assess body function and body structure (impairment) through the
          measurement of anthropometrics, muscle strength and pulmonary function in subjects with DMD
          through the multicenter CINRG network.

          Aim 2: Longitudinally assess activity limitations in subjects with DMD through CINRG with
          timed motor performance, burden of care, and functional status.

          Aim 3: Longitudinally assess secondary conditions in subjects with DMD, and relative risks
          of developing those conditions based on exposure to preventive interventions.

          Aim 4: Longitudinally assess participation, life satisfaction, service utilization and
          health-related quality of life in subjects with DMD.

          Aim 5: Determine appropriate outcome measurements for impairment, activities (activity
          limitations), participation and quality of life to determine the effect of prednisone and
          other therapeutic interventions on these factors.

          Aim 6: Using the most robust impairment, activity, participation and quality of life outcome
          measures, determine the sample size, power and statistical methods for the analysis of the
          effect size for future planned randomized-controlled rehabilitation interventions in DMD.

          Aim 7: Examine the associations between interventions and incidence and severity of
          secondary conditions, achievement of disease milestones and measures of motor function and
          mobility.

          Aim 8: To assess the validity and responsiveness of novel clinical outcome measures in DMD,
          including the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the 9-hole peg test (9-HPT) Egen Klassification
          Scale(EK), the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), and quantitative key and pinch grip
          strength testing.

          Aim 9: To assess the reliability, validity and responsiveness of novel patient-reported
          outcome(PRO) measures in DMD, including the NeuroQOL and PedsQL Neuromuscular Module.

          Aim 10: To assess the clinical meaningfulness of novel objective clinical outcome measures
          by assessing their ability to predict milestones of loss of ability to stand from supine, to
          stand from a seated position, to climb stairs, to ambulate independently and to raise a hand
          to the mouth.

          AIM 11: To determine the impact of development and growth on outcome measure performance,we
          will assess physical function on a group of healthy, typically developing male children and
          adults between 6 and 30 years of age for outcome measures of motor function and strength
          including the9-HPT, 6MWT, NSAA, timed function tests and quantitative muscle strength (QMT).
          Test results from this cohort will be used to develop initial percent predicted for age
          values for these assessments.

          SNP Genotyping Study Aim

          Our goal of the proposed study is to define polygenic modifiers of disease progression, and
          also response to treatment with glucocorticoids (prednisone and deflazacort). The most
          common type of human genetic variation is the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, a base
          position at which two alternative bases occur at an appreciable frequency (>1%) in the
          population. SNPs are 90% of variation in the human genome. SNPs occur on the average of 1
          per 1000 to 2000 bp throughout the 3.2 billion bp of the human genome while coding region
          SNPs (cSNPs) occur on the average of 1 per 346 bp.

          Genome-wide Association Study Aim

          Our goal of the proposed study is to isolate genomic DNA and find possible correlations of
          clinical phenotypes with gene loci associated with mild vs. severe clinical presentation,
          progression, or response to steroids.

          Serum Biomarkers Study Aim

          Our goal is to discover and validate sensitive and specific serum biomarkers for DMD.

      The incidence of DMD is considered equal across racial and ethnic groups. At the start of
              the CINRG program, it was assumed by investigators that the aggregate subject populations
              of the participating US sites should closely mirror the racial and ethnic distribution of
              the US population.

              DMD is an X-linked recessive disease affecting only males. However, female carriers of the
              disease can be symptomatic due to skewed X-inactivation, a secondary genetic event. We
              have opted to study the most commonly affected population, males, to ensure subject
              homogeneity. As such, there are no outreach programs planned for women in this study.
  criteria:
    textblock: |-
      DMD Subject Inclusion Criteria

                -  Affected subjects must be male and between the ages of 2 and 30

                -  Affected subjects between the ages of 2 and 4 must have a diagnosis of DMD confirmed
                   by at least one the following OR have an older male sibling that meet at least one of
                   the following criteria:

                     -  Dystrophin immunofluorescence and/or immunoblot showing complete dystrophin
                        deficiency, and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy OR

                     -  Gene deletion test positive (missing one or more exons) in the central rod
                        domain exons 25-60) of dystrophin, where reading frame can be predicted as
                        'out-of-frame',and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy.

                     -  Complete dystrophin gene sequencing showing an alteration (point mutation,
                        duplication, other) that is expected to preclude production of the dystrophin
                        protein(i.e. nonsense mutation, deletion/duplication leading to a downstream
                        stop codon),with a typical clinical picture of DMD.

                -  Affected subjects between the ages of 5 and 30 must either fulfill the above criteria
                   OR show evidence of a dystrophinopathy and clinical picture consistent with Duchenne
                   Muscular Dystrophy

                     -  Participants who have documented clinical symptoms referable to a
                        dystrophinopathy and direct support of the diagnosis by either (1) a positive
                        DNA analysis for dystrophin mutation, (2) a muscle biopsy demonstrating abnormal
                        dystrophin, or (3) an elevated CK (>5X normal), and X-linked pedigree and an
                        affected family member who meets either criterion (1) or (2) as described above.

              NOTE: Determination of the appropriate clinical symptoms consistent with DMD will
              generally be the responsibility of the clinician. At a minimum this will include
              progressive loss of function, with additional consideration for other clinical features
              such as a characteristic gait, a positive Gower sign and calf pseudohypertrophy. When
              immunostaining of muscle biopsy is used to determining case definition, the clinical
              reviewer (site PI) should confirm that appropriate testing has ruled out a secondary
              deficiency of dystrophin. Affected subjects that do not exhibit the above symptoms
              consistent with DMD should be excluded.

              o Muscle weakness prevalent by 5 years of age

              - Non-affected adult subjects must be Parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of an eligible
              affected subject.

              DMD Serum Biomarker Inclusion Criteria

                -  Participants must meet eligibility criteria for the DMD phenotyping portion of this
                   study

                -  For the GC-treatment response cohort, participants must initiate GC treatment within
                   the first year of study participation (i.e. between their first study visit and their
                   one year follow-up visit)

              DMD Subject Exclusion Criteria

              For those subjects that confirm DMD diagnosis through a clinical picture consistent with
              DMD

                -  Steroid-na√Øve subjects ambulating past the 13th birthday

                -  Steroid users ambulating past the 16th birthday

                -  Subjects/families who are unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol study
                   procedures or visits

              Controls Subject Inclusion Criteria

    Blood samples are being collected for single-nucleotide polymorphism, Genome-wide
          Association Study, and biomarker analyses.

  - Muscular Dystrophies
  - Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne
brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The purpose of this study is to establish the largest long-term assessment of people with
          Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study, the investigators associated with the
          Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group CINRG) will take a detailed look (for
          a minimum of eight years) at DMD participant's physical abilities, the medical problems they
          experience, and how they use health care services. Physical abilities will be compared to a
          group of healthy controls.

          The second purpose of this study is to find out whether small, normal differences in the
          genetic makeup of people with DMD (called "single nucleotide polymorphisms" or "SNPs")
          affect how their disease progresses and relates to muscle strength/size and steroid
          response.

          The third purpose of this study is to study genetic variations associated with DMD.

          The final purpose of this study is to determine whether certain biomarkers are present in
          people with DMD and not in healthy controls.
