brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The purpose of this study is to determine if ACE-031 is safe and well-tolerated in children
          with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and to select the optimal doses of ACE-031 in terms
          of safety and pharmacodynamic (PD) activity for designing future studies. [Note: This study
          was terminated based on preliminary safety data. Pending further analysis of safety data and
          discussion with health authorities, a new ACE-031 trial will be planned]
