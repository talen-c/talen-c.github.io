    Duchenne Muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a deadly X-linked disease affecting 1 in 3,500 males.
          DMD patients suffer significant disability due to skeletal myopathy and excess death due to
          cardiomyopathy. Current guidelines advocate initiating cardioprotective treatment with
          evident global cardiac dysfunction, yet this treatment paradigm has not improved survival
          much beyond the third decade of life. Potentially promising approaches like gene therapy
          will take considerable time to improve outcomes. Recently completed studies in a DMD mouse
          model at our institution indicate that existing drugs known as aldosterone antagonists,
          typically reserved for advanced heart failure patients, preserve skeletal and cardiac muscle
          function at 80% of normal. Clinical studies at many centers including ours have shown that
          high-resolution, noninvasive cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) detects subclinical myocardial
          fibrosis and abnormal regional function prior to global functional abnormalities. Combining
          findings from these preclinical and clinical studies, we plan to execute a randomized,
          controlled clinical trial (RCT) of eplerenone plus background therapy vs. background therapy
          alone in patients with DMD. We expect that the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone compared to
          standard therapy significantly delays progressive cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy using
          highly reproducible imaging biomarkers selected for efficient sample size design, to
          ultimately reduce disability and death.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common muscular dystrophy, leads to skeletal and
          cardiac muscle damage. Treatment of pulmonary complications has improved survival; however,
          heart muscle disease or cardiomyopathy has emerged as a leading cause of death, typically by
          the third decade. Although myocardial changes begin early, clinically significant heart
          disease is rarely detected in the first decade of life. Consequently, DMD cardiomyopathy
          frequently goes unrecognized (and untreated) until advanced (and irreversible).

          Current DMD cardiovascular care guidelines recommend beta-blockers and angiotensin
          converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) when decreased ejection fraction (EF) is noted by
          echocardiography (echo); however, this strategy has not significantly improved outcomes. Our
          team has recently made a breakthrough in a mouse study, showing in a model that causes the
          same heart muscle disease in humans with DMD adding an old medicine traditionally used for
          high blood pressure and late-stage heart failure can actually prevent heart muscle damage.
          Because of this drug's proven safety in both children and adults, it is ready to be studied
          immediately in an RCT in patients with DMD to hopefully show, as we did in mice, that we can
          prevent the devastating consequences of heart muscle damage.
