    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, progressive and fatal muscle disease affecting
          boys and accounts for 80% of muscular dystrophy cases. Tadalafil and sildenafil are
          medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary
          hypertension. This class of medication improves muscle blood flow in a mouse model of
          muscular dystrophy, but their benefit to boys with DMD is unknown. The purpose of this study
          is to perform an efficient dos-titration study to inform the design of a randomized
          multicenter trial of PDE5A inhibition for clinical skeletal muscles and cardiac endpoints.

          The investigators will enroll boys with DMD between the ages of 7 and 15 years who are
          ambulatory and without clinical heart failure. Participants will undergo five visits and one
          follow up phone call over a one month period. The initial visit will include a medical
          history, physical exam, echocardiogram, and blood draw to determine eligibility for the
          study.

          Eligible boys will be given two different study drugs: sildenafil and tadalafil. At the
          first set of visits, the boys will take a low dose (0.5mg/kg) of the sildenafil for the
          first day and a high dose (1.0mg/kg) for the second day. Blood will be drawn at specific
          timepoints to obtain drug levels (15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-hours post
          dosing). The boys will be asked to return approximately one week later for the second set of
          visits to take the other study drug, tadalafil. The boys will be take a low dose (0.5mg/kg)
          of tadalafil for the first day and a high dose (1.0mg/kg) for the second day. Again, blood
          will be drawn at specific timepoints.

          All eligible subjects will be given both open-label sildenafil initially and then tadalafil.

          There will be five clinic visits (screening visit, two sets of medication visits) and one
          follow up phone call. For these visits, boys will undergo an arm blood flow and hand grip
          exercise protocol. In this procedure, blood flow and oxygen delivery to the forearm muscles
          will be measured (noninvasively) before and during application of lower body negative
          pressure at rest and during handgrip exercise. Lower body negative pressure stimulates the
          blood flow changes that normally occur when a person sits up after lying down. During the
          medication visits, boys will have a saline lock inserted in a vein in their arm to obtain
          blood for study drug levels.

          A one week follow-up telephone call will be done to check for any adverse events.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    PDE5A inhibition, which boosts NO-cGMP signaling, will relieve functional muscle ischemia
          and restore normal blood flow regulation (i.e., functional sympatholysis) during exercise in
          boys with DMD. The investigators specific aim is to perform an efficient dose-titration
          study to inform the design of a randomized multicenter trial of PDE5A inhibition for
          clinical skeletal muscle and cardiac endpoints.
