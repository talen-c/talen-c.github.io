      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  clinical diagnosis of DMD, confirmed by muscle biopsy and molecular analysis by MPLA;

                -  range of age between 4 -16 years;

                -  unaided ambulation for at least 75 meters, unassisted during the Screening 6MWT.
                   Other personal assistance or use of assistive devices for ambulation (eg, short leg
                   braces, long leg braces or walkers) is not permitted.

                -  follow-up of at least 1 year before baseline with the selected motor outcome
                   measures;

                -  patients able to perform evaluation tests;

                -  patient legally authorized representative (LAR) able to understand and give the
                   informed consent;

                -  absence of contra-indications to the use of flavocoxid (see below);

                -  written informed consent signed by LAR.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  treatment with other drugs analogue, similar or interacting with flavocoxid or
                   immunosuppressive therapy (other than corticosteroids) within 3 months prior to start
                   of study treatment;

                -  exposure to another investigational drug or supplements within 2 months prior to
                   start of study treatment;

                -  presence of cognitive impairment that could influence the performance of the
                   evaluation tests;

                -  history of major surgical procedure within 30 days prior to start of study treatment;

                -  expectation of major surgical procedure (eg, scoliosis surgery) during the 12-month
                   treatment period of the study;

                -  ongoing participation in any other therapeutic clinical study;

                -  expectation of recruitment in the forthcoming exon-51 trial;

                -  requirement for daytime ventilator assistance;

                -  presence of liver-diseases or assumption of any hepatotoxic agent;

                -  screening laboratory values out of the laboratory ranges if clinically meaningful;

                -  prior or ongoing medical condition (eg, concomitant illness, psychiatric condition,
                   behavioral disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings, ECG
                   findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could
                   adversely affect the safety of the subject, makes it unlikely that the course of
                   treatment or follow-up would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study
                   results.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Objective of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of flavocoxid administered at
          the daily oral dose of 500 or 1000 mg/die for one year in DMD patients, alone or in
          association with steroids (deflazacort on alternate days) started at least one year before.
          The investigators will also perform a multidimensional clinical evaluation covering
          functional and muscle strength and quality of life (QoL)assessments.
