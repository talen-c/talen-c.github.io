    Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy experience progressive muscle weakness as they grow
          up. Corticosteroids are currently the only medicine that has been shown to increase muscle
          strength in boys with DMD. Benefits include an increase in the length of time that boys
          could continue to walk, reduction in the development of curvature of the spine, a longer
          time of adequate breathing, and possible protection against the development of heart
          problems.

          Doctors have tried different ways of prescribing corticosteroids in order to decrease
          undesirable side effects of the drug. No controlled, long-term study has ever looked at the
          effects of different corticosteroids to see which one improves strength the most and which
          one causes the fewest side effects, over a period of time. Different doctors in different
          countries prescribe the drugs in different ways, and some do not prescribe corticosteroids
          at all.

          The FOR DMD study will enroll boys with DMD ages 4-7. The study will look at three ways of
          taking the following corticosteroids by the mouth to determine which increases muscle
          strength the most, and which causes the fewest side effects:

            1. Prednisone 0.75mg/kg/day

            2. Prednisone 0.75mg/kg/day switching between 10 days on and 10 days off treatment

            3. Deflazacort 0.9mg/kg/day.

          The study will take place at 40 academic medical centers in the United States, Canada,
          United Kingdom, Germany and Italy.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Evidence of signed and dated informed consent form.

                -  Confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy

                -  Age greater than or equal to 4 years and less than 8 years old

                -  Ability to rise independently from floor, from supine to standing

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan and
                   study procedures

                -  Ability to maintain reproducible FVC measurements.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  History of major renal or hepatic impairment, immunosuppression or other
                   contraindications to corticosteroid therapy.

                -  History of chronic systemic fungal or viral infections. Acute bacterial
                   infection(including TB) would exclude from enrolment until the infection had been
                   appropriately treated and resolved.

                -  Diabetes mellitus.

                -  Idiopathic hypercalcuria.

                -  Lack of chicken pox immunity and refusal to undergo immunization.

                -  Evidence of symptomatic cardiomyopathy at screening assessment (one to three months
                   prior to the baseline visit). Asymptomatic cardiac abnormality on investigation would
                   not be an exclusion.

                -  Current or previous treatment (greater than four consecutive weeks of oral therapy)
                   with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive treatments for DMD or other recurrent
                   indications (e.g., asthma).

                -  Inability to take tablets, as assessed by the site investigator by the end of the
                   screening period (the screening period ranges from one to three months prior to the
                   baseline visit).

                -  Allergy/sensitivity to study drugs or their formulations including lactose and/or
                   sucrose intolerance.

                -  Severe behavioral problems, including severe autism.

                -  Previous or ongoing medical condition, medical history, physical findings or
                   laboratory abnormalities that could affect safety, make it unlikely that treatment
                   and follow up will be correctly completed or impair the assessment of study results,
                   in the judgment of the site investigator.

                -  Weight of less than 13 kilograms.

                -  Exposure to any investigational drug currently or within 3 months prior to start of
                   study treatment.

  textblock: |-
    The Finding the Optimum Regimen for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (FOR DMD) study will compare
          three ways of giving corticosteroids to boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to
          determine which of the three ways increases muscle strength the most, and which causes the
          fewest side effects. Using the results of this study, the investigators aim to provide
          patients and families with clearer information about the best way to take these drugs.
