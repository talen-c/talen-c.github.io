  textblock: |-
    This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, 48-week study to evaluate the
          efficacy and safety of SRP-4045 and SRP-4053. Eligible patients with out-of-frame deletions
          that may be corrected by skipping exon 45 or 53 will be randomized to receive once weekly
          intravenous (IV) infusions of 30 mg/kg SRP-4045 or 30 mg/kg SRP-4053 respectively
          (combined-active group, 66 patients) or placebo (33 patients) for 48 weeks.

          Clinical efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits, including functional
          tests such as the six minute walk test. All patients will undergo a muscle biopsy at
          Baseline and a second muscle biopsy over the course of the study.

          Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests,
          electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), vital signs, and physical examinations
          throughout the study.

          Blood samples will be taken periodically throughout the study to assess the pharmacokinetics
          of both drugs.
