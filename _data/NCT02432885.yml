  textblock: |-
    Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) are diseases characterized by progressive
          skeletal muscle degeneration and replacement by fibrofatty tissue. Data on cardiac
          involvement (defined as myocardial fibrosis), effect of ACE-inhibitors and specific genetic
          mutations on myocardial involvement detected by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is lacking.

          The study will include 76 patients with DMD/BMD. All patients will be referred to two CMRs
          for assessment of ventricular function and myocardial fibrosis. Patients with myocardial
          fibrosis and normal left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) will be randomized into two
          groups, each group receiving ACE-inhibitor treatment or no treatment for cardiomyopathy. A
          genetic profile will be performed in every patient to identify possible mutations related to
          cardiac involvement.

  textblock: |-
    This trial intends to evaluate myocardial Fibrosis progression in Duchenne and Becker
          Muscular Dystrophy, as well the influence of ACE inhibitors in fibrosis progression.
          Additionally, this study aims to determine genetic predictors of cardiac involvement in
          these dystrophies.
