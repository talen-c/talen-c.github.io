  textblock: |-
    DMD is an X-linked disorder in which the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin is effectively
          absent. Males with DMD typically die in the third and fourth decades of life of
          cardiopulmonary disease. Mouse models of DMD, autopsy data, and in vivo human studies using
          magnetic resonance-based late gadolinium enhancement imaging (LGE) have shown that
          progressive myocardial damage is well underway before left ventricular ejection fraction (LV
          EF) becomes abnormal.

          Exertional symptoms and signs of myocardial disease are typically absent as skeletal muscle
          disease progressively limits functional capacity in affected boys. Thus, cardiac involvement
          can go undetected until LV dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis are advanced. While
          echocardiography remains a useful tool to evaluate LV dysfunction, CMR with LGE is
          advantageous for DMD patients since it identifies myocardial injury before decline in EF is
          apparent by echocardiography. Further, greater reproducibility affords efficient sample
          sizes for cardiomyopathy clinical trials in patients with rare diseases. CMR's increasing
          availability at DMD clinical centers has afforded earlier cardiomyopathy detection, and has
          helped refine current management to typically include agents such as angiotensin converting
          enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) once damage is evident. This strategy, however, may not be
          sufficient, with prior studies showing decline in systolic function with or without ACEI or
          angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy.

          The investigators previously tested mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism (MRA) added to
          ACEI while EF was still normal in a mouse model that mimics the myocardial damage seen in
          DMD patients. This combination significantly reduced myocardial injury and improved (made
          more negative) LV circumferential strain (Ecc), a sensitive and early marker of LV systolic
          dysfunction. Additionally, preliminary findings from a recently completed clinical trial
          suggests efficacy of eplerenone vs. placebo, while further preclinical data suggests greater
          benefit without concomitant steroid use. Thus, a non-inferiority trial comparing MRAs is
          needed.

  textblock: |-
    The study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of spironolactone vs. eplerenone in preserving
          cardiac and pulmonary function in patients with preserved LV ejection fraction. Males with
          Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) confirmed clinically and by mutation analysis will be
          enrolled. Subjects must also be non-ambulatory and not taking corticosteroids at the time of
          enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to either eplerenone or spironolactone. Subjects
          will use a drug diary to record daily compliance of taking the study medication as well as
          any concerns they may have during the study period. Subjects will undergo cardiac magnetic
          resonance imaging (CMR) and pulmonary function tests (PFT) at baseline and then again at 12
          months post enrollment. Subjects will also complete a quality of life questionnaire at
          baseline and 12 months. Degree of elbow contracture will be measured using a goniometer at
          baseline and 12 months.
