    This is a phase II, double-blind, exploratory, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical
          study in ambulant subjects with DMD resulting from a mutation that can be corrected by exon
          skipping induced by GSK2402968. The study aims to randomise 54 subjects. There will be 2
          parallel cohorts. Each cohort will include subjects on GSK2402968 and matched placebo in a
          2:1 ratio.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Ambulant subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a mutation in the
                   DMD gene, confirmed by a state-of-the-art DNA diagnostic technique covering all DMD
                   gene exons, including but not limited to MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe
                   Amplification), CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation) or H-RMCA (High-Resolution
                   Melting Curve Analysis), and correctable by GSK2402968-induced DMD exon 51 skipping,

                -  Males, at least 5 years of age and with a life expectancy of at least 1 year

                -  Able to rise from floor in ≤7 seconds (without aids/orthoses),

                -  Able to complete the 6MWD test with a distance of at least 75m

                -  Receiving glucocorticoids for a minimum of 6 months immediately prior to screening,
                   with no significant change in total daily dosage or dosing regimen for a minimum of 3
                   months immediately prior to screening and a reasonable expectation that total daily
                   dosage and dosing regimen will not change significantly for the duration of the study

                -  QTc <450msec

                -  On adequate contraception

                -  Able to comply with and complete all protocol requirements

                -  Acute illness within 4 weeks of the first dose

                -  Use of prohibited meds within 6 months of fist dose

                -  Current participation in any other investigational clinical trial

                -  Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody test, or human
                   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test at screening
