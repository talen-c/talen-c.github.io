      Inclusion Criteria:

                1. Ambulatory boys age 6 to <10 years old (at the time of randomization), diagnosed with
                   DMD. Diagnosis must be confirmed in subject's medical history and by genetic testing
                   obtained during routine clinical care for diagnostic purposes as reported from an
                   appropriate regulated laboratory using a clinically validated genetic test (genetic
                   testing is not provided by the sponsor).

                2. Subjects who are able to perform the 4 stair climb in > or = 0.33 but < or =1.6
                   stairs/second.

                3. Subjects must be receiving glucocorticosteroids for a minimum of 6 months prior to
                   signing informed consent. There should be no significant change (>0.2 mg/kg) in
                   dosage or dose regimen (not related to body weight change) for at least 3 months
                   immediately prior to signing the informed consent and a reasonable expectation that
                   dosage and dosing regimen will not change significantly for the duration of the
                   study.

                4. Adequate hepatic and renal function on screening laboratory assessments.

                5. No underlying disposition for iron accumulation on screening laboratory assessments.

                6. Iron content estimate on the screening liver MRI is within the normal range.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                1. Subjects with known cognitive impairment or behavioral issues that would impede the
                   ability to follow instructions.

                2. History of major surgical procedure within 6 weeks of signing the informed consent or
                   planned surgery during the study.

                3. Any injury which may impact functional testing. Previous injuries must be fully
                   healed prior to consenting. Prior lower limb fractures must be fully healed and at
                   least 3 months from injury date.

                4. Presence or history of other musculoskeletal or neurologic disease or somatic
                   disorder not related to DMD including pulmonary and cardiac disease.

                5. Compromised cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction <55% as determined
                   on a screening cardiac MRI or echocardiogram). Subjects may be receiving ACE
                   (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors or beta blockers, ARB (angiotensin II
                   receptor antagonist) or aldosterone blocker/thiazide diuretic; however they must have
                   initiated treatment more than 3 months prior to screening to ensure stable therapy.

                6. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
                   pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular (including uncontrolled hypertension),
                   hepatic, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding
                   untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

                7. Documented history of iron overload including hemochromatosis, beta thalassemia
                   major, beta thalassemia intermedia or hemolytic anemia.

                8. Unwilling or unable (eg, metal implants, requires sedation) to undergo examination
                   with closed MRI without sedation.

                9. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) for a minimum of 30
                   days or within 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to signing the informed
                   consent and/or during study participation.

               10. Current or prior treatment with Exon skipping, nonsense mutation targeted therapies
                   or utrophin.

               11. Current or prior treatment within the past 3 months with androgens or human growth
                   hormone.

               12. Current treatment with immunosuppressant therapies (other than glucocorticoid
                   steroids), aminoglycosides (eg, gentamicin), multi vitamins with iron and iron
                   supplements and other investigational therapies.

  textblock: |-
    This is a Phase 2 randomized, 2-period, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending
          dose study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of PF-06252616 administered to
          ambulatory boys diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Three intravenous (IV) dose
          levels will be investigated in a within subject dose escalating fashion. Subjects will be
          randomly assigned to 1 of 3 sequence groups for approximately 96 weeks (2 periods of 48
          weeks each). In period 1, two of the sequence groups will receive PF-06252616 and one
          sequence group will receive placebo. In period 2, the placebo group will switch to
          PF-06252616 and the two remaining sequence groups will either receive placebo or
          PF-06252616. Efficacy will be based on an observed mean change from baseline on function (4
          stair climb) of PF-06252616 as compared to the placebo at the end of period 1. Period 2
          provides an opportunity to evaluate PK. Subjects will receive monthly IV infused doses of
          either PF-06252616 or placebo and will undergo safety evaluations (Laboratory, cardiac
          monitoring, physical exams, x-ray, MRI), functional evaluations (pulmonary function testing,
          4 stair climb, range of motion, strength testing, Northstar Ambulatory Assessment, upper
          limb functional testing and the six minute walk test), pharmacokinetic testing and
          pharmacodynamic testing to evaluate changes in muscle volume (MRI).
