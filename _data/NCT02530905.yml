  textblock: |-
    This is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-titration study to assess safety,
          tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 4 dose levels of SRP-4045 in genotypically confirmed
          advanced-stage DMD patients with deletions amenable to exon 45 skipping.

          After completion of the dose-titration portion of the study and SRP-4045 is determined to be
          safe, all patients will be evaluated on open-label SRP-4045 for the duration of the study.

          Safety, including adverse event monitoring, routine laboratory assessments, and cardiac
          testing will be monitored through the duration of the dose-titration and open-label portions
          of the study.

          Clinical efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits via quality of life
          questionnaires and tests of pulmonary and upper extremity function through the duration of
          the dose-titration and open-label portions of the trial.
