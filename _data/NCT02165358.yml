    The purpose of this study is to investigate the paradoxical muscle enlargement seen in
          patients affected by Becker muscular dystrophy and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I.

          Becker and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies are both hereditary muscular disorders. Both
          diseases appear clinically with shrinkage and muscle weakness of the muscles around the
          shoulder girdle and pelvis, while muscle hypertrophy of the calves and tongue is seen.

          The quality of the enlarged calves has to the investigators knowledge not previously been
          described, and their hypothesis is that the normal correlation between muscle strength and
          muscle cross-section is absent in the calf muscles. Thus the investigators hypothesis
          suggests that there is no actual hypertrophy of the calf muscles, but rather a
          pseudohypertrofy with reduced force per cross-sectional area. With a picture of increased
          fat infiltration and disorganized muscle fibers.

          The enlarged calves' muscle quality will be assessed primarily on the basis of the muscle
          structure on MRI (assessed on both T1 imaging, 3-point Dixon scans, and diffusion tension
          imaging), and based on a calculation of muscle strength per cross-sectional area. Isokinetic
          muscle dynamometry (Biodex-4) will be used to measure muscle strength. The findings will be
          compared with results from non-affected controls.

          Additionally the investigators want to describe the tongue muscle appearance on T1-weighted
          MRI.

    the investigators will describe muscle quality by:
    MRI scans of the calves comprising of a T1-weighted MRI scan, a 3-point Dixon scan to measure the fraction of fat in the muscle, a short TI inversion recovery (STIR) scan, and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan to see the muscle fiber organization.
    The MRI scans will further be used to measure the fat free muscle cross-sectional area of the muscle groups responsible for plantar flexion and dorsi flexion respectively.
    Biodex muscle strength measurements: Isokinetic muscle dynamometry measurements on plantar flexion and dorsal flexion over the ankle.
    Calculating of muscle strength per muscle cross-sectional area
