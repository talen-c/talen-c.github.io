    The study will enroll boys with nonsense mutation DBMD who have a history of exposure to
          ataluren in a prior PTC study in nmDBMD (PTC124-GD-004-DMD, PTC124-GD-004e-DMD,
          PTC124-GD-007-DMD, PTC124-GD-007e, and PTC124-GD-008-DMD) at a trial site in Europe, Israel,
          Australia, or Canada. Patients will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch,
          and dinner). Study assessments will be performed at clinic visits during screening and every
          12 weeks during the 96-week treatment period. Patients must also return to the clinic for a
          post-treatment visit 6 weeks after the last dose of ataluren.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Evidence of signed and dated informed consent/assent document(s) indicating that the
                   subject (and/or his parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent aspects
                   of the trial

                -  Male sex

                -  Confirmed screening laboratory values within the specified ranges

                -  In subjects who are sexually active, willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse
                   or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during ataluren administration
                   and the 6-week follow up period

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
                   study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Exposure to another investigational drug within 1 month prior to start of study
                   treatment

                -  Eligibility for another ataluren clinical trial that is actively enrolling study
                   participants

                -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of study drug

                -  Ongoing use of the following medications: coumarin based anti-coagulants, phenytoin,

                -  Ongoing uncontrolled medical/surgical condition, ECG findings, or laboratory
                   abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of
                   the patient or make it unlikely that follow-up would be completed

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is
          caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining
          normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads
          to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type
          of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in
          approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
          investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense
          mutation. This study is an open-label trial for patients with nonsense mutation
          dystrophinopathy who received ataluren in a prior PTC-sponsored study at a clinical trial
          site in Europe, Israel, Australia, or Canada. The primary objective of the study is to
          evaluate the long-term safety of ataluren, as determined by adverse events and laboratory
          abnormalities.
