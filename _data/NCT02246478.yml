    Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in
          childhood, affecting approximately 1 in every 3500 lives male births. DMD patients suffer
          from a relentless decline in muscle strength that impairs the ability of walking and
          breathing, resulting in their lives with wheelchairs and loss of upper body function. The
          objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic of TAS-205 after
          single and multiple doses in DMD patients. It is also evaluated if TAS-205 affects the
          urinary excretion of pharmacodynamic (PD) marker in DMD patients.
