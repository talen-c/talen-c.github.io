    DMD is the most common and devastating type of muscular dystrophy (incidence 1 in 3500 live
          born males worldwide). DMD is characterized by a complete loss of dystrophin, leading to
          progressive muscle weakness and wasting.

          No cure is currently available despite our present understanding of the disorder and the
          discovery and characterization of the causative gene and its protein product dystrophin in
          1987. Corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort) may delay disease progression and until now
          it is the only treatment that proved to be beneficial for patients with DMD. Other
          alternative supplements like creatine and glutamine also delay diseased progression.

    Participants will be randomized to receive either pentoxifylline or placebo in addition to their stable steroid therapy. Active drug and placebo preparations will be supplied as gel capsules of identical size, appearance and taste. Active drug capsules will contain one 400 mg time-release pentoxifylline tablet and inert filler. Placebo capsules will contain inert filler.
    Based on weight at screening, <30 mg will receive 1 400 capsule/day; 30-49 kg will receive two 400 capsules/day; 50 kg or greater will receive three 400 mg capsules/day.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The purpose of this study is to see if male children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
          have changes in strength when given the drug Pentoxifylline as a rescue treatment. A total
          of 64 subjects are expected to participate through all other centers of the Cooperative
          International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) worldwide.

          The primary purpose of this study is to see whether the addition of pentoxifylline to a
          steroid regimen is effective in treating deteriorating muscle strength by comparing the
          muscle strength of PTX treated subjects and placebo treated subjects.
