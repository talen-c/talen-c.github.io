    This is an open label, multiple dose extension study to assess the ongoing efficacy, safety,
          and tolerability of weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of eteplirsen in DMD subjects who have
          successfully completed Study 4658-us 201.

          Subjects will have the opportunity to enroll in this study during the last visit of Study
          4658-us-201 (Week 28). Eligible subjects will receive once weekly IV infusions of eteplirsen
          (50 or 30 mg/kg) for an additional 212 weeks. Subjects will receive the same dose of
          eteplirsen they received in Study 4658-us-201.

          Safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and biomarker assessments will be performed at
          scheduled visits; adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications and therapies will be
          continuously monitored.

          If review of data from this open label study suggests that continued treatment with
          eteplirsen is warranted, this study may be extended by protocol amendment or subjects who
          successfully complete this study may have the opportunity to participate in a separate
          follow on, open label eteplirsen study.

      Inclusion Criteria:

              A subject must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for this study.

                1. The subject and/or their parent/legal guardian are willing and able to provide signed
                   informed consent.

                2. The subject has successfully completed 28 weeks of treatment in Study 4658-US-201.

                3. The subject has a parent(s) or legal guardian(s) who is able to understand and comply
                   with all of the study procedure requirements.

              Exclusion Criteria:

              A subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study.

              1. The subject has a prior or ongoing medical condition that, in the Investigator's
              opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the subject or make it unlikely that the
              course of treatment or follow-up would be completed or impair the assessment of study
              results.

          muscular dystrophy (DMD) subjects who have successfully completed the 28 week eteplirsen
          study: Study 4658-us-201. This study will also evaluate the correlation between biomarkers
          for DMD and the clinical status of participating DMD subjects.
