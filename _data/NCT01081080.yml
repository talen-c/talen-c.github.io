  textblock: |-
    This protocol will exploit novel state of the art cardiovascular magnetic resonance
          techniques to examine important changes in the heart in children with muscular dystrophy.
          The purpose of this study is to compare cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with the collected
          cardiac outcome data obtained in protocol: PITT1109 - Cardiac Outcome Measures in Children
          with Muscular Dystrophy.
