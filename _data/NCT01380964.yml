                -  Informed consent signed

                -  Nonacute or chronic muscular, allergic, infectious, endocrine or inflammatory
                   disorder in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion

  description: This study will establish the relevance of urinary and blood biomarkers
    for the diagnosis, follow-up and assessment of treatment response in patients
    with DMD (IBiSD1, 2 and 4). IBiSD will also attempt to establish the seroprevalence
    to the different strains of AAV in patients with DMD (IBiSD3).
  measure: IBiSD aims to identify and validate new and disease-specific biomarkers.
