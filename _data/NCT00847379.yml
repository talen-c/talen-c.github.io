    This Phase 2b, open-label, safety and efficacy study is anticipated to be performed at 37
          sites in 11 countries. The study will enroll up to 174 boys with nonsense mutation DMD/BMD
          who participated in a previous Phase 2b study of ataluren (PTC124) (PTC124-GD-007-DMD,
          NCT00592553). Subjects will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and
          dinner) for approximately 96 weeks (approximately 2 years). Study assessments will be
          performed at clinic visits during screening, every 6 weeks for 2 visits and then every 12
          weeks until the end of the study. Additional safety laboratory testing, which may be
          performed at the investigational site or at an accredited local laboratory or clinic, is
          required 3 times during the course of the study.

      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Completion of blinded study drug treatment in the previous Phase 2b study
                   (PTC124-GD-007-DMD).

                -  Ability to provide written informed consent (parental/guardian consent if
                   applicable)/assent (if <18 years of age).

                -  In subjects who are sexually active, willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse
                   or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during PTC124 administration
                   and the 6-week follow up period.

                -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
                   study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of the study drug
                   (Litesse® UltraTM [refined polydextrose], polyethylene glycol 3350, Lutrol® micro
                   F127 [poloxamer 407], mannitol 25C, crospovidone XL10, hydroxyethyl cellulose,
                   vanilla, Cab-O-Sil® M5P [colloidal silica], magnesium stearate).

                -  Ongoing participation in any other therapeutic clinical trial.

                -  Prior or ongoing medical condition (eg, concomitant illness, psychiatric condition,
                   behavioral disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings, ECG
                   findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could
                   adversely affect the safety of the subject, makes it unlikely that the course of
                   treatment or follow up would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study
                   results.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It
          is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for
          maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility
          that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A
          specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of
          DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally
          delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the
          nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 2b extension trial that will evaluate the long-term
          safety of ataluren (PTC124) in boys with nonsense mutation DMD/BMD, as determined by adverse
          events and laboratory abnormalities. The study will also assess changes in walking, muscle
          function, and other important clinical and laboratory measures.
