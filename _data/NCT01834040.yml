    Muscular dystrophies, or MD, are a group of inherited conditions, which means they are
          passed down through families. They may occur in childhood or adulthood. There are many
          different types of muscular dystrophy. They include:

          Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy that worsens quickly. Other
          muscular dystrophy (including Becker's muscular dystrophy) get worse much more slowly.

          Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the
          muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the
          condition.

          Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. They may include:

          Fatigue

          Learning difficulties (the IQ (intelligence quotient )can be below 75)

          Intellectual disability (possible, but does not get worse over time)

          Muscle weakness

          Begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other
          areas of the body

          Difficulty with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping)

          Frequent falls

          Trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs

          Weakness quickly gets worse

          Progressive difficulty walking

          Ability to walk may be lost by age 12, and the child will have to use a wheelchair

          Breathing difficulties and heart disease usually start by age 20
