    The current clinical trial including people with Becker's muscular dystrophy and established
          deficiency in muscular content of nNOS protein consist of three sub-studies focusing on each
          of muscle function, cardiac function and brain function. In muscular dystrophy the
          dystrophin cellular complex usually located to muscle cells, is disrupted resulting in a
          known reduced nNOS activity. The reduced nNOS leads to reduced cyclic GMP production. nNOS
          and cyclic GMP are involved in the vascular response in striate muscle, cardiac vessels as
          well as the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia and regional activation. In muscular
          dystrophy, the is an affected muscular and cardiac function and in some patients a changed
          cognitive function in described. Whether such is related to a reduced nNOS function and
          subsequent cGMP production is not fully understood. Inhibition of cGMP degradation by
          inhibiting the cGMP degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) using PDE5 inhibitors such
          as sildenafil may result in restoration of vascular responses.

          The study is designed as a double blind, randomised, balanced, placebo-controlled cross-over
          study performed during a 10 week treatment period. The patients will receive 4 weeks of
          either sildenafil or placebo with a 2 week washout period in between treatments. The study
          out-come parameters will be performed on two consecutive days at baseline, 4 weeks and 10
          weeks, at two collaborating centers, Rigshospitalet for muscle and cardiac parameters and
          Glostrup Hospital for cerebrovascular and cognitive parameters.

          The primary endpoints relate to each sub-study, assessing and comparing individual changes
          from baseline and during placebo/sildenafil treatment.

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    This study is done to evaluate whether treatment with the drug sildenafil (Revatio®) can
          improve muscular, cardiac, cerebrovascular or cognitive function in patients with Beckers
          muscular dystrophy when compared to placebo (inactive medication). The study is based on the
          recent findings of an improved cardiac function in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy
          (Adamo et al 2010) and the previous findings of changed cognitive function in people with
          Becker dystrophy.

          In muscular dystrophy, the cellular protein, dystrophin is affected. During normal
          conditions, the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which produce nitric oxide
          (NO), is attached to dystrophin. NO is important in normal vascular function in each of
          muscle, heart and brain by stimulating production of cyclic GMP. However, in muscular
          dystrophy with dystrophin deficiency, nNOS do not have the normal cellular anchor, resulting
          in decreased NO levels and subsequent reduced cyclic GMP production. Sildenafil inhibits
          degradation of cGMP thus prolonging and increasing a cGMP response. Such effects are the
          basis for use of sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension and erectile dysfunction. Current
          hypothesis: Sildenafil restores the cyclic GMP function affected in muscular dystrophy wit
          nNOS deficiency resulting in improved muscle, cardiac, cerebrovascular and cognitive
          function.
