      Inclusion Criteria:

                -  Ambulant subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a mutation/deletion
                   within the DMD gene, confirmed by a state-of-the-art DNA diagnostic technique
                   covering all DMD gene exons, including but not limited to MLPA (Multiplex
                   Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification), CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation),
                   SCAIP (Single Condition Amplification/Internal Primer) or H-RMCA (High-Resolution
                   Melting Curve Analysis), and correctable by GSK2402968-induced DMD exon 51 skipping.

                -  Males, aged at least 5 years, and with life expectancy of at least 1 year

                -  Able to complete 6MWD test with minimal distance of at least 75m at each predrug
                   visit. In addition, results of 6MWD must be within 20% of each other at each pre-drug
                   visit

                -  Receiving glucocorticoids for a minimum of 6 months immediately prior to screening,
                   with no significant change in total daily dosage or dosing regimen for a minimum of 3
                   months immediately prior to screening and a reasonable expectation that total daily
                   dosage and dosing regimen will not change significantly for the duration of the study

                -  QTc <450msec (based on single or average QTc value of triplicate ECGs obtained over a
                   brief recording period), or <480 msec for subjects with Bundle Branch Block. Note:
                   QTc may be either QTcB or QTcF, and machine read or manual overread.

                -  Subjects, where appropriate, must be willing to use adequate contraception (condoms
                   or abstinence) for the duration of the study and for at least 5 months after the last
                   dose of study drug.

                -  Willing and able to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures,

                -  Able to give informed assent and/or consent in writing signed by the subject and/or
                   parent(s)/legal guardian (according to local regulations).

                -  French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study
                   only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category.

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Any additional missing exon for DMD that cannot be treated with GSK2402968

                -  Current or history of liver or renal disease or impairment

                -  Acute illness within 4 weeks of the first anticipated administration of study
                   medication which may interfere with study assessments

                -  Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents, previous treatment
                   with investigational drugs, within 6 months of the first administration of study
                   medication; and idebenone or other forms of Coenzyme Q10 within 1 month of the first
                   administration of study medication.

                -  Current or anticipated participation in any investigational clinical studies

                -  Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody test (if verified via RIBA
                   or PCA testing), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test at screening,

                -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy. If subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction <45%
                   at Screening, the investigator should discuss inclusion of subject in the study with
                   the medical monitor,

                -  Children in Care. The definition of a Child in Care is a child who has been placed
                   under the control or protection of an agency, organisation, institution or entity by
                   the courts, the government or a government body, acting in accordance with powers
                   conferred on them by law or regulation. The definition of a child in care can include
                   a child cared for by foster parents or living in a care home or institution, provided
                   that the arrangement falls within the definition above. The definition of a child in
                   care does not include a child who is adopted or has an appointed legal guardian.
