    NPC-14 will be administrated as following steps. The dose of NPC-14 will be calculated and adjusted by a non-blinded medical doctor and/or a non-blinded pharmacist.
    An initial dose of NPC-14 will be half of that calculated by distribution volume：Vd based on patient age for safety reason.
    After the initial administration, the dose of NPC-14 will be adjusted and maintained by actual Vd, therapeutic drug monitoring of peak serum levels of NPC-14

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is inherited neuromuscular disorders due to mutation in
          the gene that encodes critical muscle protein called dystrophin. Currently, there is no
          effective treatment option for the disease. A pharmacological approach by promoting mRNA
          translation regardless of the presence of premature stop codons by nonsense mutation, called
          the readthrough strategy, has been developing recently for DMD with nonsense mutation.
          NPC-14 is a candidate compound for the readthrough strategy, since effective readthrough
          activities were demonstrated in nonclinical studies. This study is a phase II study designed
          to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of NPC-14 in ambulant DMD patients with
          nonsense mutation that were confirmed by whole genome analysis. These goals will be
          accomplished by monitoring adverse events by physical examination, cardiac, pulmonary,
          auditory, balance, and laboratory tests as safety endpoints, and dystrophin expression in
          muscle biopsy as primary efficacy endpoint, muscle function (NSAA, timed test, muscle
          strength (QMT, MMT) , dairy activities by lifecorder), and biomarkers as secondary efficacy
          endpoints. The study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 21 DMD
          patients. After screening, eligible patients are allocated dynamically to weekly NPC-14 or a
          placebo (saline) in a 2:1 ratio and will receive study drugs for 36 weeks.
