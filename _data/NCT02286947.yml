    This is an open-label, multi-center, 96-week study to explore the safety and tolerability of
          eteplirsen injection in patients with advanced stage DMD with confirmed genetic mutations
          amenable to treatment by exon 51 skipping.

          Patients will be evaluated for inclusion during a Screening/Baseline period of up to 4
          weeks. Eligible patients will receive once weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 30 mg/kg
          eteplirsen for up to 96 weeks. An extension to the dosing period may be considered prior to
          the end of the 96-week planned dosing period.

          Safety will be regularly assessed throughout the study via the collection of adverse events
          (AEs), laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), vital signs,
          and physical examinations. Exploratory efficacy assessments, including PFTs, upper extremity
          testing, and other measurements of functional status, will occur at functional assessment
          visits every 12 weeks over the first year of treatment and approximately every 24 weeks over
          the second year of treatment.

                -  Diagnosis of DMD with a mutation that is amenable to exon 51 skipping, confirmed by a
                   genetic report

              Exclusion Criteria:

                -  Use of any pharmacologic treatment (other than corticosteroids) within 12 weeks that
                   may have an effect on muscle strength or function (e.g., growth hormone, anabolic
                   steroids).

                -  Previous treatment with SMT C1100/BMN 195 at any time.

                -  Previous treatment with drisapersen (PRO051) within the last 6 months.

                -  Major change in physiotherapy regimen within the past 3 months

                -  Major surgery within 3 months

                -  Presence of other clinically significant illness

                -  Use of an aminoglycoside antibiotic within 12 weeks or the need for this antibiotic
                   or statin during study

                -  Forced vital capacity % predicted [FVC % predicted] <40%, or requiring daytime
                   ventilation.

                -  Require antiarrhythmic and/or antidiuretic therapy for heart failure.

                -  Have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of <40%.

                -  Prior or ongoing medical condition that could adversely affect the safety of the
                   patient, make it unlikely that the course of treatment would be completed, or impair
                   the assessment of study results.

    The primary objective of this study is to explore safety and tolerability of eteplirsen in
          patients with advanced stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are amenable to exon 51
          skipping. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the effect of eteplirsen on pulmonary
          function tests (PFTs) and other functional clinical measures.
