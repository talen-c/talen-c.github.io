    The participants who are not regularly seen at our regional hospital, are recruited via
          their local neuropediatrician. Patients who do not come to our region hospital will be seen
          at their local hospital.Each participant will be seen three times with one year between each
          visit. The visits include clinical examination, DXA scan, x-ray for bone age, and blood
          tests including several parameters related to bone health, growth and puberty. Standardized
          questionnaires regarding quality of life (patients and parents) will be used, and certain
          questions regarding the importance of achieving normal height and puberty will be added.
          Additional anamnestic data will be retrieved from the patients' medical records.

  textblock: |-
    The study will give a consent based epidemiological overview of Norwegian patients with
          Duchenne muscular dystrophy younger than 18 years of age. Genotype of the population will be
          described. Longitudinal development of growth, bone health, and , when applicable, puberty
          over a two year period will be studied. Questionnaires regarding quality of life will also
          be an important part of the study.
