    Our research has many goals, one of which is to characterize the genetic changes responsible
          for the type of muscle disease found in our participants. In our past research, several new
          genes responsible for various forms of neuromuscular disease were identified and/or are
          being studied. These include dystrophin, the sarcoglycans, obscurin, and filamin. Each
          discovery has resulted in advances in our ability to develop diagnostic tests which benefit
          patients and their families by providing accurate diagnosis, presymptomatic and/or prenatal
          testing. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies have increased our understanding of the
          natural history of these rare disorders benefiting patients through better prognostic
          determinations by clinicians. Biochemical and pathological analysis of muscle biopsies has
          led to new insights into disease pathophysiology which we hope will aid in finding
          treatments.

          Our research also studies gene expression in muscle biopsy samples. This entails identifying
          the genes whose expression is increased or decreased in the muscles of individuals with
          different muscular dystrophy types. We believe these studies will identify genes and gene
          pathways which are common to the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy or which are unique to a
          particular dystrophy. Our microarray research should lead to a better understanding of the
          disease process and possible ways to halt the process. The end point of these studies would
          be an accurate description of the disease pathogenesis.

      Families will be ascertained world-wide as the muscular dystrophies are a pan-ethinic

  criteria:
    textblock: |-
      The samples used in this study will be derived from individuals at risk for, or suffering
              from, neuromuscular disease, generally resulting in clinical weakness of one or more
              muscle groups.

              Inclusion criteria:

                1. having a clinical and/or pathological diagnosis of a muscular dystrophy

                2. being the first degree relative of someone with such a diagnosis

                3. having had a muscle biopsy if diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease

              Exclusion Criteria:

                1. not having such a diagnosis and not being related to such an individual

                2. not wishing to participate

                3. being incapable of giving consent and not having a legal guardian willing or able to
                   do so

brief_summary:
  textblock: |-
    The purpose of this study is to identify genes and proteins responsible for specific muscle
          disorders by studying genetic material from individuals with neuromuscular disease, as well
          as their family members. We are interested in recruiting many types of neuromuscular disease
          including; Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy DMD/BMD, limb-girdle muscle dystrophy
          LGMD. There are still many patients diagnosed with muscular dystrophy but have no causative
          gene implicated in their disease. We feel that these patients may have new genetic changes
          in genes coding for important muscle proteins that we have yet to identify. Using molecular
          genetics to unravel the biochemical basis of these neuromuscular disorders should lead to
          more accurate diagnosis of these disorders and should lead to potential therapies.
