                   presentation (onset of clinical signs or symptoms before 6 years of age supported by
                   an elevated serum creatinine kinase level, and ongoing difficulty with walking)
                   together with either a record of a genetic confirmation of the DMD diagnosis, or a
                   record of muscle biopsy showing near-complete dystrophin deficiency (excluding
                   revertant fibers)

                -  Receiving systemic corticosteroids for a minimum of 6 months immediately prior to
                   screening, with no significant change in total daily dosage or dosing regimen (except
                   those adjusting for weight changes) for a minimum of 3 months immediately prior to
                   screening and a reasonable expectation that total daily dosage and dosing regimen
                   will not change significantly (except for adjustments for weight) for the duration of
                   the study

                -  Able to complete the six minute walk distance (6MWD) test with results within 20% of
                   each other at a minimum of 2 pre-randomization assessments

                -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% as determined by echocardiogram

                -  Written informed consent from parents/legal guardian will be obtained prior to any
                   study procedure being performed. In addition, the child may be required to give

                -  Cardiac rhythm disorder

                -  History of participation in gene or cell-based therapy , or antisense oligonucleotide
                   or stop codon read-through therapy

                -  Unable to take orally administered tablets

                -  Use of any pharmacologic treatment, other than corticosteroids, that might have an
                   effect on muscle strength within 3 months prior to the start of study treatment (for
                   example, growth hormone, anabolic steroids including testosterone)

                -  New or changed treatment with herbal or dietary supplements being taken with an
                   expectation of an effect on muscle strength or function during 1 month prior to first
                   dose of study drug

                -  Surgery that might have an effect on muscle strength or function within 3 months
                   before study entry or planned surgery at any time during the study

                -  Evidence of a lower limb injury that may affect performance on the 6MWD

                -  Severe behavioral problems, including severe autism or attention deficit disorders,

    The main purpose of this study is to determine if tadalafil can slow the decline in walking
          ability of boys who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The study will also assess the
          safety of tadalafil and any side effects that might be associated with it in boys who have
          DMD. Participants will receive study treatment (tadalafil or placebo) for the first 48 weeks
          of the study, and can then continue into an open label extension (OLE) that consists of two
          periods during which all participants will receive tadalafil. In OLE period 1, all
          participants will receive tadalafil for 48 weeks. Participants completing OLE period 1 will
          continue into OLE period 2 and will receive tadalafil for at least another 48 weeks.
