    Muscle Strength and Joint Range of Motion Testing - All muscle and joint testing was
          performed at the MedCenter Therapy clinic in Houston, Texas. JTech computerized testing
          system was utilized including Goniometry, Grip testing, Inclinometry, Muscle Testing and
          Joint Range of Motion testing occurred on Day 0, 30, 60, 90, 180, and repeated at 12 months
          to determine muscular strength and joint Range of Motion. JTech computerized testing system
          was chosen on the basis of reliability and accuracy. At each of the testing intervals, the
          testing was administered by the same technician with the same equipment to all of the
          participants. Inter-and intra-tester reliability of the JTech computerized testing system
          has been the subject of multiple studies. Each of which found high ICCs (>0.93) for both
          inter- and intra-tester reliability.

          All sleep studies were performed at Sleep Diagnostics of Texas in The Woodlands, Texas.
          Prior to the clinical trial, all of the participants spent two nights in the sleep unit and
          their sleep study examinations were performed. The second night was used as the Day 0 data.
          Sleep, breathing, arousals and limb movements were scored manually according to guidelines
          set forth by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The sleep studies were repeated at 6
          months and 1 year.

  - electrical nerve stimulator
  description: |-
    The VT-200, or VECTTOR system, delivers electrical stimulation via electrodes on the acupuncture points of a patient's feet/legs and hands/arms to provide symptomatic relief of chronic intractable pain and/or management of post-surgical pain.
    Once these electrodes are placed, the machine determines the appropriate choice of stimulation by automatically measuring body temperatures through the use of thermistors placed on the fingers during a testing sequence.

            system, including Goniometry, Grip Testing, Inclinometry, Muscle Testing
            and Joint Range of Motion. Testing occurred at Baseline (Day 0), 30, 60,
            90 and 180 days to determine changes in joint Range of Motion. JTech computerized
            testing system determined the joint range of motion by radio signals from
            a goniometer measuring movement of the participants' joints. 44 separate
            tests were performed for Range of Motion for each participant at each
            time interval. The results from the range of motion tests were averaged
            the percent change from baseline to 180 days. Efficacy is defined as an
            increase in range of motion.

        were obtained twice before beginning the study. The second sleep study data
        was used as baseline. A follow up sleep study was obtained after 6 months
        (180 days) of Active or Placebo VECTTOR treatment. Sleep, breathing, arousal(s),
        and limb movements were scored manually according to guidelines of the American
        Academy of Sleep Medicine. The efficacy of the outcome measure of ASI is demonstrated
        by a decrease in the value between Baseline and 180 days. The ASI is measured
        by the number of times sleep is interrupted per hour. Lower ASI values/numbers
        indicate improved sleep quality.'

          VECTTOR: The VT-200, or VECTTOR system, delivers electrical stimulation via electrodes on the acupuncture points of a patient’s feet/legs and hands/arms to provide symptomatic relief of chronic intractable pain and/or management of post-surgical pain.
          Once these electrodes are placed, the machine determines the appropriate choice of stimulation by automatically measuring body temperatures through the use of thermistors placed on the fingers during a testing sequence.

  textblock: |-
    The primary objective of this investigation is to assess the effectiveness of transcutaneous
          electrical nerve stimulation applied using VECTTOR to reduce the symptoms of Duchenne
          Muscular Dystrophy and reduce the impact of DMD upon the participants' quality of life.

          The primary outcome measures will include:

            1. increased muscle strength,

            2. increased range of joint motions and

            3. improved sleep parameters of ASI, N3 and REM.
