    Double Push Acoustic Radiation Force (DP ARF) imaging will be performed in 3 cohorts of up
          to 10 boys with DMD and in age-matched boys with no known neuromuscular disorders.

          The first DMD cohort will enroll at age 5-6, the second at age 7-8, and the third at age
          9-10. The rectus femoris (RF), cranial sartorius (CS), gastrocnemius (GAST), and lateral
          deltoid (DT) muscles will be targeted for their known phenotypic variation in response to
          dystrophin deficiency. The RF undergoes early necrosis and fatty deposition, the CS is
          thought to be relatively spared, and the GAST seems to undergo true hypertrophy. The DT,
          which undergoes hypertrophy like the GAST, will also be examined to determine if the impact
          of dystrophin deficiency varies between upper and lower limbs. All boys will be imaged 3
          times annually for 4 years. In addition to DP ARF imaging every 4 mos, the boys will undergo
          standard quantitative muscle testing (QMT) and timed function tests (TFT) of time to
          standing, 6-minute walk, and 30-feet walk. Age at loss of ambulation will also be recorded
          for each boy. Boys with DMD generally loose ambulation by age 10, so we expect that the 20
          boys in the 7-11 and 9-13 aged cohorts will lose ambulation over the course of this study.
          The 10 boys in the 5-9 aged cohort will likely not lose ambulation during the study. Because
          the primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the potential of DP ARF
          imaging as a relevant surrogate for monitoring disease progression and response to
          therapies, the focus of the study will be on correlating DP ARF results to change in
          functional degeneration and time to loss of ambulation.

          There are two experimental components to this study beyond what is standard practice for DMD
          patients: 1) DP ARF ultrasound imaging of the rectus femoris (RF), cranial sartorius (CS),
          gastrocnemius (GAST), and lateral deltoid (DT) muscles and 2) standard quantitative muscle
          testing (QMT) and timed function tests (TFTs) of time to standing, 6-minute walk, and
          30-feet walk repeated every four months (three times annually) throughout the four-year
          duration of the study.

          This study will commence with DP ARF ultrasound imaging in the Clinical Neurophysiology
          Laboratory during the patient volunteer's first regularly scheduled research visit. Patient
          volunteers are expected to be outpatients. However, if a patient volunteer is an inpatient,
          DP ARF ultrasound imaging may be performed at the patient volunteer's hospital bedside.
          Immediately following DP ARF examination, the patient volunteer will undergo QMT and TFTs in
          the Physical Therapy Department. QMT and TFT will be conducted by trained physical
          therapists. DP ARF ultrasound imaging, QMT and TFT will be repeated as described above at
          each of the patient volunteers' twelve regularly scheduled research visits over the
          four-year study duration. Whenever possible, we will schedule research visits to coincide
          with other clinical visits to UNC. The patients' parents or caregivers will be compensated
          $50 per visit to defray the costs of travel to UNC, parking and lunch.

          DP ARF will also be performed in 30 boys ages 5-14 with no known neuromuscular disorders.
          Imaging will be performed as described for the boys with DMD. The DP ARF results obtained in
          boys with no known neuromuscular disorders will be compared to those obtained in boys with
          neuromuscular disorders to serve as a control for changes in muscle mechanical property to
          occur with normal muscle growth and development.

          DP ARF ultrasound is a noninvasive diagnostic imaging technology performed using
          commercially available clinical ultrasound imaging equipment - the Siemens Acuson Antares
          imaging system equipped for research purposes and VF10-5 or VF7-3 linear array transducers
          (Siemens Medical Solutions, USA Inc. Ultrasound Division). DP ARF imaging will be carried
          out by a professional sonographer, faculty and/or graduate student research assistants in
          the UNC-CH Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering. The sonographer will acquire DP ARF
          ultrasound data with matched B-Mode (for anatomical reference) in the right RF, CS, GAST,
          and DT muscles of patient volunteers. Patient volunteers will be asked to lie on an
          examination table in the Clinical Neurophysiology Clinic (outpatients) or to remain in their
          hospital beds (inpatients). The head of the exam table/bed may be raised to an approximate
          45 degree angle to best visualize the muscles of interest with ultrasound imaging.

          Once the patient volunteer is positioned, ultrasound gel will be applied to the patient
          volunteer's skin surface above the muscles of interest. The ultrasound imaging transducer
          will then be placed on top of the gel. Once the first muscle of interest is located, DP ARF
          ultrasound imaging will begin. We will orient the transducer to acquire ultrasound data
          transverse to the muscle fibers in the middle of the muscle length-wise, with three repeated
          acquisitions. We will then rotate our transducer 90 degrees to orient the imaging plane
          parallel to the muscle fibers. The previously imaged cross-section will be positioned in the
          approximate middle of the imaging field of view, with three repeated acquisitions. Muscle
          fiber orientation will be approximate, as surmised from anatomy. The DP ARF axial focal
          depth will be directed to the center of the muscle, approximately 20 - 30 mm.

          The length of time for DP ARF data collection in each muscle is estimated to be less than 10
          minutes. Once DP ARF imaging is completed on one muscle, DP ARF imaging will be performed on
          the other muscles of interest. Once all 4 muscles (RF, CS, GAST and DT) are imaged, the
          study procedure will be completed for the DP ARF imaging portion of the study.

          For the second part of the study, beginning shortly (less than 4 hours) after DP ARF imaging
          is completed, the patient volunteer will undergo clinically standard quantitative muscle
          testing (QMT) of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in the right RF, CS, GAST
          and DT. The patient volunteer will also undergo clinically standard timed function tests
          (TFTs) of (1) time to rise from supine to standing, (2) distance walked in six minutes and
          (3) time to walk 30 feet.

          Patient volunteers' participation will end once both study parts one (DP ARF ultrasound
          imaging) and two (QMT and TFT) are completed twelve times over 4 years. Therefore, there
          will be regularly scheduled follow-up visits required of the patient volunteers every four
          months. The patient volunteer is asked to assent and his parents are asked to permit their
          son to undergo (1) DP ARF ultrasound imaging of his right RF, CS, GAST and DT muscles, and
          (2) QMT and TFTs of time to standing, 6-minute walk, and 30-feet walk. No additional
          procedures or requirements are proposed. Every other aspect of the patient volunteers' care
          for DMD will be carried out in the normal standard of care as clinically indicated.

  textblock: |-
    This is a pilot clinical trial to assess the ability of a new ultrasound-based imaging
          method, Double-Push Acoustic Radiation Force (DP ARF) ultrasound, to monitor the progression
          of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The hypothesis being tested is that DP ARF ultrasound
          delineates changes in muscle composition and function in individual dystrophic muscles, from
          early through late stages of disease development, that correlate to time to loss of
          ambulation in patient volunteers.
