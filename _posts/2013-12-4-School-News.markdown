We got word from Talen's teacher today that he is now reading at grade level. Since the beginning of the school year, he has jumped five levels to catch up with his classmates.

In Kindergarten, he got knocked out of commission with pneumonia and a long hospital stay. Last year he went out with a broken femur. Both happened right around the January/February time frame, so we're creeping back up on what we're now calling "The Cursed Season." Everybody keep your fingers crossed for us over the next few months.

I'm sure that his teacher this year (Mrs. Grimes) deserves some of the credit, and Izzy has been sitting and reading with him after school (which might be the biggest difference). Most of the credit is Talen's, though. In so many ways he works harder than everyone else just to maintain equilibrium, and he does it with such a positive attitude. What an awesome little guy...
